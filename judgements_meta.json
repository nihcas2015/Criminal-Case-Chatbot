    "text": "Appellant argued the government order was illegal under the Essential Supplies (Temporary Powers) Act, 1946 and obstruction to an illegal order could not be an offence.\nRespondent argued that an act done honestly and in good faith by a public servant in discharge of public duties suffices for offence under section 186.\nCourt considered scope of section 3 of the Act: subsection (1) confers power to regulate or prohibit production, supply, and distribution of essential commodities, and covers both general and special orders.\nSubsection (2) is illustrative; seizure of articles falls within powers under subsection (1).\nReference to the prior incomplete order (27th September, 1947) was immaterial; 5th December order valid.\nPrecedents (Calcutta High Court and Privy Council) supported wide interpretation of powers and illustrative nature of subsection (2)."
