        "case_facts": "*   **Accused:** C.I. Emden (the appellant), a Loco Foreman. *   **Allegation:** Accepted a bribe of Rs. 375 from Sarat Chandra Shukla on January 8, 1953. *   **Background:** Shukla held a contract for ash pit cleaning and coal loading. The appellant allegedly demanded a monthly bribe of Rs. 400 to prevent harassment, later agreeing to Rs. 375. *   **Prosecution:** Shukla reported the demand, and a trap was set. The appellant was caught receiving the marked currency notes. *   **Appellant's Defense:** Admitted receiving Rs. 375 but claimed it was a loan from Shukla for his children's clothing expenses. *   **Lower Courts:** The Special Judge and the Allahabad High Court convicted the appellant, finding the prosecution evidence credible and the defense story improbable. Both courts relied on the statutory presumption under Section 4 of the Prevention of Corruption Act.",
        "issues": "*   **Constitutional Validity:** Whether Section 4(1) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, which creates a statutory presumption, is unconstitutional and violates Article 14 (equality before law) of the Constitution. *   **Interpretation of Section 4(1):** *   What constitutes \"gratification\" for the presumption to be raised? Does it require proof that the gratification was a bribe? *   What is the standard of proof required from the accused to rebut the presumption (\"unless the contrary is proved\")? *   **Merits of the Case:** Whether the appellant's explanation of the Rs. 375 as a loan was reasonably probable and sufficient to rebut the presumption.",
        "arguments": "*   **On Constitutional Validity (Article 14):** *   The Court held that Article 14 does not prohibit reasonable classification. *   The classification of public servants within Section 4(1) is rational and serves the object of combating corruption, as bribery is difficult to prove directly. *   Therefore, Section 4(1) is constitutional. *   **On Interpretation of Section 4(1):** *   **\"Gratification\":** The Court ruled that \"gratification\" should be interpreted literally as satisfaction of desire. It is not limited to pecuniary gratification or proven bribes. The presumption is raised upon proof of accepting \"gratification other than legal remuneration\" or a \"valuable thing.\" This aligns with the broad intent of the Act. *   **Onus of Proof to Rebut:** The Court acknowledged that the burden on the accused to rebut the presumption is likely less than the prosecution's burden to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. However, it did not definitively decide on the exact standard, as it was not necessary for this appeal. *   **On Merits of the Case:** *   The Court found the appellant's explanation of a loan for clothing to be improbable. *   Reasons included: the appellant had a substantial bank balance and a good salary, the children's clothes were not urgently needed, and the High Court found it unlikely Shukla would offer a loan given their relationship. *   Even if the appellant's statement to the magistrate was inadmissible, the High Court's conclusion was primarily based on the oral evidence and probabilities, which the Supreme Court found sound.",
        "decision": "*   **Appeal Dismissed:** The appeal filed by C.I. Emden was dismissed. *   **Conviction and Sentence Confirmed:** The conviction and sentence passed by the High Court were upheld. *   **Section 4(1) Upheld:** The Court confirmed that Section 4(1) of the Prevention of Corruption Act is constitutional and a valid piece of legislation. *   **Presumption Applied:** The Court agreed that the presumption under Section 4(1) was rightly raised against the appellant and that he failed to rebut it with a reasonably probable explanation."

        "issues": "*   However, the High Court upheld the conviction under section 65(f) (possession of a still for manufacturing intoxicants) read with section 81, relying on a legal presumption. *   Whether the evidence was sufficient to convict the appellants for possessing illicit liquor and manufacturing it. *   Whether the presumption under section 103 of the Act, regarding the possession of a still, was correctly applied. *   Whether the appellants were given a fair opportunity to rebut the presumption under section 103. *   Whether Appellant No. 2, a servant, could be held liable for possessing the still or abetting the offence. *   **For Possession of Still (Section 65(f)):** The prosecution relied on section 103, which presumes an offence if a person is found with a still ordinarily used for manufacturing intoxicants.",
        "arguments": "*   No presumption under section 103 should apply as it wasn't proven the still was for manufacturing intoxicants *other than toddy*, and no specific questions were put to them under Section 342 Cr.P.C. to rebut this presumption. *   Appellant No. 2 argued he was merely a servant and not in possession of the still, and therefore not liable for abetment or possession. *   **Appellant No. 2:** The court found no evidence that he was in possession of the still or had abetted the offence. He was considered an employee acting under orders. His appeal was allowed. *   **Appellant No. 1:** The court found that the still in question was not ordinarily used for manufacturing toddy. While questions about rebutting the presumption under section 103 were not explicitly put, Appellant No. 1's prior statement about not knowing about the seized items suggested he would not have been able to provide a satisfactory explanation for the still. Therefore, no prejudice was caused by the lack of specific questioning.",

        "issues": "*   This led to a divergence of opinion among High Courts (Allahabad High Court took a contrary view), necessitating a special Constitutional Bench hearing. *   **Applicability of the Presidential Order to Section 491(1)(b) Cr.P.C.:** Does the bar created by the Presidential Order under Article 359(1) extend to applications made under Section 491(1)(b) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (which deals with habeas corpus-like relief)? *   **Validity of Impugned Provisions (if the bar is overcome):** Are the specific sections of the Defence of India Act and Rules, under which the detentions were made, constitutionally valid?",
        "arguments": "*   **Majority Opinion (Gajendragadkar, J. speaking for the majority):** *   **Article 359(1) and Presidential Order:** The majority concluded that Article 359(1) allows the President to suspend the *remedy* of moving any court for the enforcement of specified fundamental rights. It does not suspend the rights themselves. This suspension applies to all \"any court\" of competent jurisdiction, including the Supreme Court and High Courts. *   **Section 491(1)(b) Cr.P.C.:** The majority held that applications under Section 491(1)(b) are *not* outside the scope of Article 359(1) and the Presidential Order. They reasoned that if the challenge to detention inherently requires examining the validity of laws that violate the fundamental rights specified in the Presidential Order, then such proceedings are barred, regardless of the procedural form (Section 491(1)(b) vs. Articles 32/226). The substance of the claim, not its form, is paramount. The right to challenge detention on grounds of fundamental rights violation is considered a fundamental right itself, thus falling under the Presidential Order. *   **Pleas Outside the Bar:** The majority noted that detentions could still be challenged on grounds *not* related to the fundamental rights suspended by the Presidential Order, such as violation of mandatory procedural requirements of the Act, or mala fide actions. *   **Dissenting Opinion (Subba Rao, J.):** *   **Article 359(1) and Remedy vs. Right:** The dissent agreed that Article 359(1) suspends the *remedy* of moving courts for specified fundamental rights, not the rights themselves. *   **Section 491(1)(b) Cr.P.C.:** Crucially, the dissent argued that Section 491(1)(b) provides a *statutory* right and a distinct mechanism for challenging illegal detention, which is separate from the *constitutional* right to enforce fundamental rights under Articles 32 and 226. Therefore, the Presidential Order under Article 359(1), which specifically refers to the \"right to move any court for the enforcement of... rights conferred by Part III,\" does *not* apply to proceedings under Section 491(1)(b). The High Court's power under Section 491(1)(b) was considered discretionary and not contingent on enforcing a fundamental right in the same way as Articles 32/226. *   **Validity of Impugned Provisions:** The dissent found the Act and Rules to be void for infringing Article 22(4) and (5) of the Constitution. *   **Pleas Outside the Bar:** The dissent agreed that mala fide actions or detentions not made under the Act/Ordinance could still be challenged.",
        "decision": "*   The Presidential Order under Article 359(1) effectively bars citizens from moving any court (including High Courts under Section 491(1)(b) Cr.P.C.) to challenge their detention if such a challenge relies on the infringement of fundamental rights specified in the Order (Articles 14, 21, 22). *   The impugned provisions of the Defence of India Act and Rules were found not to suffer from excessive delegation. *   The appeals were to be set down before a Constitution Bench to deal with other contentions raised in each individual appeal that were not barred by Article 359(1). *   **Overall Outcome:** The appeals were largely dismissed based on the interpretation of Article 359(1), meaning the detenues could not challenge their detention on the grounds of violation of fundamental rights during the emergency period as long as the Presidential Order was in effect. However, individual appeals could proceed on grounds *outside* the scope of the Presidential Order."

(appellant No. 1) and its Manager, Om Prokash Manglik (appellant No. 2), received a consignment of mustard oil (approx. 499 maunds) from Firozabad to Calcutta on December 25, 1954. *   **Sampling:** On January 3, 1955, a Food Inspector, Dr. Nityananda Bagui, took three samples of the oil from the tank wagon at Calcutta. One sample was given to the Manager (appellant No. 2), and two were kept by the Inspector. *   **Analysis:** One sample sent to the Public Analyst on January 3, 1955, was reported as adulterated on January 4, 1955, with a detailed report on January 24, 1955. A third sample, sent for analysis during the trial, was also found to be adulterated with groundnut oil. *   **Adulteration:** The mustard oil was found to be adulterated with groundnut oil. *   **Appellants' Claim:** The appellants presented a report from an oil expert who stated the oil conformed to Agmark specifications and was free from adulterants. However, this report was not proven in court. Another analysis by Sri N. Mitra suggested the oil approximated genuine mustard oil but wasn't definitive. *   **Previous Proceedings:** The Calcutta High Court affirmed the conviction of the appellants under Section 462 of the Calcutta Municipal Act, 1951.",
        "issues": "*   Was the mustard oil in the tank wagon adulterated? *   Were the appellants in possession of the adulterated mustard oil at the time of sampling? *   Can the presumption that the oil was stored for sale under Section 462(4) of the Act be rebutted?",
        "arguments": "*   **Adulteration:** The court found the analysis reports from the Public Analyst and the Court Witness (Dulal Chandra Dey) to be reliable, confirming the adulteration of the mustard oil with groundnut oil. The court discounted the analysis that suggested approximation to standards, noting it was not conclusive and that the sample analyzed might not have been from the appellants' wagon. *   **Possession:** The court inferred possession based on the circumstances. The consignment was to the company itself, and its manager (appellant No. 2) would have needed to take delivery from the railway authorities to access the wagon and its contents. This delivery was presumed to have occurred before the sampling. *   **Rebutting Presumption:** The appellants argued that their arrangements with the U.P. Oil Millers Association and their letter (Exhibit R) rebutted the presumption of storing for sale. The court found these arrangements insufficient. The letter only stated they might take delivery if the oil was found pure, without specifying what would happen if it was impure. The court viewed these arrangements as a \"subtle device\" to hinder authorities.",
        "decision": "*   The court upheld the findings of the lower courts that the mustard oil was adulterated. *   The court held that the appellants were in possession of the adulterated oil when the samples were taken. *   The court ruled that the appellants failed to rebut the legal presumption that the oil was stored for sale under Section 462(4) of the Act. *   Therefore, the conviction of the appellants under Section 462 of the Calcutta Municipal Act, 1951, was deemed correct.

The word \"produced\" is crucial and not synonymous with \"cited.\" *   The Magistrate *may* take evidence of other witnesses if he deems it necessary *in the interests of justice*.

        "arguments": "*   The Court also clarified that a Magistrate has the jurisdiction to commit or discharge an accused based solely on the documents referred to in section 173 of the CrPC, even if no witnesses are examined, if they are satisfied. *   The Court noted that while the discretion under section 207A(4) is judicial and can be reviewed, the procedure in this case was not illegal.",
        "decision": "*   The Court dismissed both appeals. *   The Court held that the Magistrate was not bound to examine all witnesses or even any witnesses under section 207A(4) of the CrPC if the prosecution did not produce them, or if the Magistrate, in his judicial discretion, did not find it necessary in the interests of justice. *   Therefore, the committal of the appellants to the Sessions Court without examining witnesses was not illegal, and their trial and conviction were valid."

        "arguments": "*   Section 5(3) is a rule of evidence, not a new offense. It creates a presumption that the accused is guilty of criminal misconduct as defined in Section 5(1). *   The charge against the appellant was specifically for criminal misconduct under Section 5(1)(c). The Special Judge acquitted him of this specific act. *   The prosecution's case was that the Rs. 9,284.10 was the result of dishonest misappropriation (5(1)(c)).

        "issues": "*   **Constitutionality of Section 4 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947:** The appellant argued that the presumption provisions in this section violated Article 21 of the Constitution (\"procedure established by law\"). *   **Jurisdiction of the Special Judge:** The appellant contended that the Special Judge who tried the case lacked territorial jurisdiction. *   **Corroboration of Evidence:** The appellant argued that there was insufficient corroboration for the contractor's (Basu) statement regarding the demand and acceptance of the bribe.",
        "arguments": "*   **Constitutionality of Section 4:** The Court held that \"law\" in Article 21 refers to State-made law. Since Section 4 was enacted by Parliament, it constitutes \"procedure established by law\" and is therefore constitutional. This was not considered a substantial question of law requiring a larger bench. *   **Jurisdiction of the Special Judge:** *   The offence occurred in Dhanbad, but the trial was by a Special Judge in Patna. *   The Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1952, stipulated that such offences should be tried by the Special Judge for the area where the offence was committed. *   However, the Court noted that the High Court had the power to transfer cases. *   The case had been transferred to Patna at the appellant's request. *   Crucially, no objection to jurisdiction was raised at the start of the trial, and the appellant did not appear prejudiced. *   The Court invoked Section 531 of the Criminal Procedure Code, which states that no conviction should be set aside for lack of territorial jurisdiction if no failure of justice has occurred. They found no failure of justice. *   **Corroboration of Evidence:** *   The court reviewed the evidence of Basu, Kanjilal (Basu's employee), and Mr. K.N. Mookerjee (Superintendent of Police). *   While there was no direct witness to the demand in December 1950, the timing of Basu informing the authorities in June 1951, and the subsequent trap laid, suggested certainty. *   The appellant's presence at Dhanbad railway station at the appointed time, arranged via Kanjilal, was considered unlikely to be accidental. *   The appellant's explanation for his presence was disbelieved. *   The act of placing the \"fat\" envelope (containing Rs. 10,000) into his trouser pocket, rather than carrying it openly or in a coat pocket, was seen as inconsistent with receiving ordinary contract papers. *   The purpose of the meeting at Dhanbad was deemed to be more than just delivering papers, which could have been sent through regular channels. *   While the appellant wasn't specifically questioned about every detail under Section 342 of the CrPC, the Court found he was aware of the case against him and the evidence, and his denial of receiving the bribe indicated he understood the bribe aspect.",
        "decision": "The Supreme Court **dismissed** the appeal. *   The Court upheld the constitutionality of Section 4 of the Prevention of Corruption Act. *   The Court found that the Special Judge's conviction was valid despite a potential lack of territorial jurisdiction, as no failure of justice had occurred and the appellant had not been prejudiced. *   The Court found sufficient corroboration of the contractor's testimony, both circumstantial and inferential, to uphold the conviction for accepting the bribe."

They argued that Section 18(1) and (2) impose joint and several liability on the owner, agent, and manager. *   The manager's defense that the rule was on the owner was rejected because Section 18(2) imposes vicarious liability, subject to a defense of taking all reasonable means to prevent contravention. The manager failed to prove this defense. *   The dissenting judge (Mudholkar J.) argued that \"mining operations\" should be interpreted narrowly and not extended to employment and amenities. He also contended that Section 18(2) requires the manager to have had the power to enforce the owner's duty, which was not the case here, thus absolving the manager of vicarious liability. *   The appeal was **dismissed** by the majority. *   The conviction of the owner (Goenka) was upheld. *   The conviction of the manager (Gupta) was upheld based on the majority interpretation of Section 18 of the Mines Act, 1952, making him liable for the owner's contravention in the absence of proof of taking all reasonable preventative measures.

Section 8(1) specifically points to the procedure for warrant cases by magistrates (Sections 251-259 of the Code). Section 8(3) applies other provisions of the Code as if the Special Judge were a Court of Session, which does not include Section 350. *   The Court noted that a subsequent amendment explicitly made Section 350 applicable to Special Judges, but this amendment did not apply to the present case. *   The Court found that Section 350 could not be applied to a Special Judge without doing violence to its language, as it specifically refers to a magistrate succeeding another magistrate. The amendment itself created a fiction of the Special Judge being a magistrate for this purpose, indicating the original Act did not intend it. *   The Court held that the defect was not a mere irregularity but a want of competency, as the trial was conducted in a manner not conceived by the law as it stood.

        "arguments": "*   Roopram's statement was inadmissible because Jawanaram did not state in court that he had told Roopram the names of the assailants. *   Without Roopram's corroboration, Jawanaram's testimony alone was insufficient, especially as some co-accused were acquitted. *   Criticisms regarding Ram Partap's presence and the FIR timing should invalidate Jawanaram's testimony. *   **Admissibility of Roopram's statement:** The Court disagreed with previous interpretations of Section 157 of the Indian Evidence Act.

It is *not* necessary for the corroborated witness to state in court that they made the former statement to the corroborating witness. *   **Sufficiency of Jawanaram's testimony:** The Court found that Roopram's testimony *was* admissible and corroborated Jawanaram's statement regarding the assailants. Therefore, it wasn't a case of entirely uncorroborated testimony.

This section shifts the burden of proof to the individual from whom certain goods (like gold, diamonds, cigarettes, cosmetics) are seized, requiring them to prove the goods are *not* smuggled. *   **Specific Case (Civil Appeals 408-410 of 1960):** *   Gold weighing approximately 1,000 tolas was seized from an employee of Nathella Sampathu Chetty & Sons (the respondent) at a Madras railway station. *   The Collector of Customs ordered the confiscation of the gold, believing it to be smuggled, and placing the burden of proof on the respondent to show it wasn't. *   The respondent challenged this order in the Madras High Court, arguing, among other things, that Section 178A was unconstitutional.",
        "issues": "*   Whether Section 178A applied to contraventions of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1947 (FERA). *   Whether the \"reasonable belief\" condition precedent for seizure under Section 178A was met in the specific case of the respondent. *   On the **\"reasonable belief\" prerequisite**, the Court examined the facts of the seizure. It concluded that the circumstances at the time of seizure (large quantity of gold, lack of proper documentation, an undelivered letter concerning the purchase) were sufficient to form a \"reasonable belief\" by the Customs Officer that the gold was smuggled. It distinguished between the subjective belief and the objective assessment by the adjudicating authority.",
        "arguments": "*   The law was necessary to combat widespread smuggling, which posed a significant threat to the national economy. *   Similar provisions exist in other legal systems (e.g., UK Customs Consolidation Act). *   A rational connection exists between the fact of seizure in reasonable belief of smuggling and the fact of smuggling itself. *   The restrictions were reasonable and in the interest of the general public, necessary for effective enforcement and to achieve a vital state objective. *   The \"reasonable belief\" of the seizing officer is a subjective prerequisite, but the ultimate adjudication is quasi-judicial, allowing for examination of the grounds for belief. *   Section 178A was an unreasonable restriction on the rights to hold property (Article 19(1)(f)) and carry on business (Article 19(1)(g)). *   The burden of proof placed on the individual was impossible to discharge, especially concerning the origin of gold, effectively leading to confiscation without proper adjudication. *   The \"reasonable belief\" of the seizing officer, often based on undisclosed information, provided no real safeguard. *   There was no rational connection between the \"reasonable belief\" and the fact of smuggling. *   The section applied retrospectively to gold imported before restrictions were imposed, making proof impossible. *   Section 178A did not apply to prohibitions under FERA due to specific legislative incorporation clauses.",

        "arguments": "*   **Nature of the Preparation:** The evidence, including expert chemical and Ayurvedic analysis, strongly suggested the preparation was not genuine \"Mrugmadasav\" due to the high alcohol content, lack of musk, and the discrepancy in cost if musk were a significant ingredient. The court found it was likely fit for intoxicating use. *   **Section 24A Applicability:** For Section 24A to apply, the preparation must be unfit for use as intoxicating liquor AND correspond to the description and limitations in Section 59A (regarding alcohol quantity for extraction/preservation or fermentation). The high alcohol content here exceeded these limits, and the preparation was deemed fit for intoxicating use. *   **Burden of Proof:** The burden lies with the State to prove the ingredients of the offense. While Section 24A carves out exceptions, the State must still prove the infringement of Sections 12 and 13, which includes showing the preparation wasn't covered by Section 24A. *   **Section 6A (Board of Experts):** Section 6A mandates the State to constitute a Board and imposes a duty on the Board to advise the government. However, there is no explicit or implied obligation for the State to consult the Board in *every* case before prosecution. Failure to consult means the State cannot rely on the presumption under Section 6A and must affirmatively prove its case, which it did. *   **Bhopal Permit/Duty:** Permits and excise duties paid in another State do not have extra-territorial effect and do not protect against violations of the laws of the importing State. The respondents also failed to produce any license under Section 11 of the Bombay Prohibition Act to justify their possession.",

The Court found this delivery to be a transfer of possession, not a fresh seizure \"under the Act\" for the purpose of Section 178A. *   **Possession and Burden of Proof:** Section 178A places the burden on \"the person from whose possession the goods are taken.\" When goods are delivered to Customs by a Magistrate, they are no longer in the possession of the accused in a way that would trigger Section 178A. *   **High Court's Reliance:** The High Court erred by solely relying on Section 178A, as the delivery of gold under Section 180 did not meet the criteria for a \"seizure under this Act.\" *   **Sessions Judge's Finding:** The Sessions Judge had also made an independent finding of guilt based on positive evidence, which the High Court did not consider.",

        "issues": "*   A significant legal question was the interpretation and application of Section 307 of the Code of Criminal Procedure concerning references from a Sessions Judge when disagreeing with a jury's verdict. *   The court also had to determine if there were misdirections in the Sessions Judge's charge to the jury that vitiated the verdict. *   Finally, the court had to decide if the appellant's actions constituted murder or culpable homicide not amounting to murder, specifically whether grave and sudden provocation applied.",
        "arguments": "*   **Jurisdiction of High Court (Section 307 CrPC):** The appellant argued the High Court's power under Section 307 was limited and it could not set aside a jury verdict based on misdirections. The Supreme Court, after analyzing the legislative history and provisions of Section 307, clarified that the High Court's power in a reference case is broader than in a regular appeal. It can consider the entire evidence and set aside a verdict if it's perverse, unreasonable, or vitiated by misdirections, to prevent miscarriage of justice. *   **Misdirections by Sessions Judge:** The High Court identified several misdirections. The Supreme Court, after detailed examination, agreed with the High Court on key misdirections: *   **Section 105 Evidence Act and Section 80 IPC:** The Sessions Judge failed to adequately explain the burden of proof on the accused regarding exceptions (like accident under Section 80 IPC) and the legal presumption against the accused under Section 105 of the Evidence Act. *   **Circumstantial vs. Direct Evidence:** The Judge wrongly applied the stringent rules for circumstantial evidence to the extra-judicial confession, which is direct evidence. *   **Sylvia's Letters:** The Judge omitted to refer to important letters from Sylvia to Ahuja, which cast doubt on Nanavati's and Sylvia's versions of events, amounting to a non-direction. *   **Admissibility of Police Statements:** The Judge wrongly allowed evidence to contradict Puransingh's statement based on an inadmissible police statement. *   **Grave and Sudden Provocation:** The appellant argued that Sylvia's confession of adultery constituted grave and sudden provocation. The Court, after examining English and Indian case law, concluded that while words and gestures *could* amount to provocation in India, the appellant's actions and the lapse of time between the confession and the murder indicated that he had regained his self-control and the murder was premeditated, not a spontaneous reaction of passion. The court emphasized that the \"reasonable man\" test is crucial and the mode of retaliation must be proportionate to the provocation. *   **Evidence of Intent:** The Court analyzed Nanavati's conduct before, during, and after the shooting, including taking the revolver on a false pretext, his unceremonious entry into Ahuja's bedroom, his statements to witnesses (Puransingh, Samuel), and the nature of the bullet wounds. The evidence strongly indicated premeditation and intent to kill, rather than an accidental shooting during a struggle. Medical and ballistic evidence was found to be inconsistent with the defense's theory of accident.",
        "decision": "*   The Supreme Court held that the High Court was justified in interfering with the jury's verdict due to grave misdirections in the Sessions Judge's charge. *   The Court found that the appellant's actions were not a result of grave and sudden provocation, as he had regained his self-control. *   The evidence conclusively established that the appellant intentionally shot and killed Ahuja. *   Therefore, the conviction of the appellant for murder under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code and the sentence of life imprisonment imposed by the High Court were upheld. *   The appeal was dismissed."

The High Court's reasons for doubting Ujagar Singh's account (improbability of his presence in the field due to crop height) were considered inconsistent and unconvincing by the Supreme Court. *   The Supreme Court found no enmity between Ujagar Singh and the appellant, making his testimony credible. *   The act of the appellant bathing in the canal at night was considered not improbable given the circumstances and the desire to wash off blood. *   The circumstances, including the enmity, the purchase of the blood-stained sword, and the extrajudicial confession to Ujagar Singh, were considered to fully establish the appellant's guilt.",

They found no material discrepancies in the key witness Arjan Singh's statements and considered the reasons for rejecting his testimony unconvincing. They believed Arjan Singh's account was corroborated by other witnesses and that Ajmer Singh's identity as the assailant was clear. *   **Procedural Defect (Section 342 Cr.P.C.):** The court acknowledged that the Sessions Judge's examination of Ajmer Singh was indeed defective and did not comply with the requirements of Section 342 Cr.P.C.

The refusal by the High Court in the previous revision to consider the circumstances related to the City Exchange and telephone number \"City 6091\" was a grave error, as this was a new and decisive piece of evidence bearing on the forgery allegation. *   **Sanction:** Agreed with the Special Bench that the complaint primarily disclosed offenses of forgery and using forged documents, not criminal conspiracy requiring sanction under Section 196A.

The prisoner filed a petition in the Punjab High Court, and subsequently a writ petition in the Supreme Court, alleging that his confinement in a separate cell under paragraph 575 of the Punjab Jail Manual violated Article 14 of the Constitution, arguing it conferred arbitrary power and resulted in discriminatory treatment.",

        "arguments": "**Majority (Subba Rao, C.J. et al.):** *   **On Paragraph 575:** The rules for separation of prisoners are part of an integrated scheme for maintaining jail discipline. Classification based on sex, age, nature of crime, and cell availability is reasonable and relates to the objective of discipline. The power of the Superintendent to separate prisoners is limited and subject to clear conditions, and therefore, paragraph 575, in its context, does not violate Article 14. *   **On Malice and Discrimination:** The prisoner's allegations detailed his confinement in a separate cell from his arrival, often for extended periods, even as an undertrial. The prisoner claimed this was for ulterior motives and discriminatory. The Superintendent's counter-affidavit admitted to separate confinement for jail offenses and for discipline/accommodation reasons. However, the majority found that the prisoner was segregated in a manner not authorized by law, and the restrictions imposed exceeded those allowed by law for solitary, cellular, or separate confinement. The Superintendent acted illegally by confining the prisoner in a way that amounted to almost solitary confinement without proper authorization or adherence to legal limitations. The Court emphasized the importance of humane treatment and rehabilitation over vindictiveness in modern criminology. **Minority (Raghubar Dayal, J.):** *   **On Paragraph 575:** Agreed with the majority that paragraph 575 of the Jail Manual does not violate the Constitution. *   **On Malice and Discrimination:** Disagreed with the majority, finding no illegal confinement. The prisoner's rude and defiant behavior justified his placement in a cell under paragraph 569A of the Jail Manual for maintaining discipline. The entries in the punishment register, though brief, were sufficient records of jail offenses. The Superintendent's actions were motivated by jail discipline, not ulterior motives. Separation of prisoners, as per paragraphs 571-575 and Section 28 of the Prisons Act, is for jail management and discipline, not necessarily solitary or cellular confinement as punishment, and it's permissible to keep a prisoner separate if their association is detrimental to discipline. The fact that the prisoner was not allowed to associate with co-accused was justified to maintain discipline.",

The respondent was directed to confine the petitioner in prison strictly in compliance with the Prisons Act and its rules.

Criticism of government measures, however strong, is permissible if it doesn't incite violence or disorder. *   Sections 124A and 505 were interpreted to penalize only such activities that have the *intention or tendency* to create disorder, disturbance of law and order, or incitement to violence. *   The explanations to Section 124A were considered to clarify that criticism aimed at lawful alteration of measures, without exciting hatred or contempt, is not an offense. *   The court also found Section 505 to be constitutional as its elements directly related to the security of the State or public order. *   The Supreme Court held that Sections 124A and 505 of the Indian Penal Code, when **interpreted to require an intention or tendency to create public disorder or incite violence**, are **constitutional**. *   The Court ruled that criticism of the Government or its measures, even if strongly worded, is permissible under Article 19(1)(a) as long as it does not incite violence or tend to create public disorder. *   **Criminal Appeal No. 169 of 1957 was dismissed**, as the speech in question was found to come within the interpreted scope of sedition and likely to create public disorder. *   **Criminal Appeals Nos. 124 to 126 of 1958 were allowed** and remanded to the High Court to be decided in light of the Supreme Court's interpretation. This implies that the High Court's acquittals, based on an overly broad interpretation of Section 124A, were to be revisited."

The convictions stemmed from an incident on March 17, 1959, where the deceased, chaukidar Anandi Paswan, and another chaukidar, Misri Paswan, were allegedly accosted. The prosecution claimed the appellants forcibly took the chaukidars away. Anandi Paswan was later found dead with two gunshot wounds. The motive was alleged to be revenge by the appellants against Anandi Paswan for his role in reporting their criminal activities and for helping police arrest one of Ramchandra Chaudhary's associates. The trial court sentenced all three to death, and the Patna High Court confirmed these sentences. The appellants appealed to the Supreme Court.",
        "issues": "*   Whether the appellants were correctly identified as the perpetrators of the murder. *   Whether the prosecution sufficiently established the common intention to commit murder among all the accused, particularly for Jogendra Chaudhary and Nepali Master. *   Whether the evidence, including identification, was legally admissible and reliable. *   Whether an anonymous letter (Exhibit 6), which corroborated the motive, was admissible in evidence, especially in light of Section 162 of the Criminal Procedure Code.",
        "arguments": "*   **Identification:** The primary evidence was from Misri Paswan (P.W.2), who identified Ramchandra Chaudhary and Jogendra Chaudhary. Several other witnesses also identified Ramchandra and Jogendra. For Nepali Master, the defense argued that identification by only one witness at a test identification parade was insufficient. The court noted that Nepali Master was identified by two witnesses and that even a single witness can be credible if the court finds them truthful. *   **Common Intention:** The court reasoned that the appellants came together, two of them carrying guns, and acted in concert to abduct the chaukidars. Statements made at the time, suggesting revenge for the arrest of a servant (Motia Mushar) and sarcastic remarks about the deceased's \"military,\" indicated a shared intention to commit murder. *   **Admissibility of Exhibit 6:** The defense argued that Exhibit 6, an anonymous letter mentioning the deceased's actions against \"that poor Mushar,\" was inadmissible under Section 162 CrPC as it was received during the investigation. The court distinguished between the *period* of investigation and the *course* of investigation. It held that Section 162 bars statements *recorded* by a police officer during investigation, not all communications received during that time. Exhibit 6, along with a document in Nepali Master's handwriting (Exhibit 3), was sent to a handwriting expert who confirmed they were from the same source. This established the motive, and the admissions in Exhibit 6 were admissible under Section 21 of the Evidence Act as corroboration for the identification witnesses.",

It found that the evidence, including witness testimonies and the corroborating anonymous letter, sufficiently established the guilt of all three appellants.

About a month and a half before the murder, Prabhu and his father approached Bhagwan again, requesting land transfer to Prabhu, which Bhagwan refused, stating he intended to give his land to his granddaughter. *   **The Murder:** Bhagwan was found murdered on the night of March 19-20, 1961. He sustained multiple incised injuries. A granddaughter sleeping with him was unharmed. A neighbor heard noises and the sound of someone running away but did not see the assailant. *   **Investigation:** The police were informed.

Argued that statements made to the police leading to the recovery were inadmissible under Sections 25 and 26 of the Indian Evidence Act.

There was no evidence proving these items belonged to him or were used by him. *   Stated that circumstantial evidence must be such that it is inconsistent with the innocence of the accused. In this case, the mere production of the items, even if blood-stained, did not exclude the possibility of someone else committing the murder and the items being kept in Prabhu's house.

To secure short-term credit, they devised a scheme where small consignments were booked, and the railway receipts were then forged to show larger quantities and higher values. These forged receipts were used to draw demand drafts and hundis, which were then discounted by banks and firms in Kanpur. The forged receipts were endorsed in favor of specific firms, and the banks and firms obtained payment in Calcutta. To cover up the fraud, delivery of the actual small consignments was taken using indemnity bonds, claiming the original receipts were lost. The scheme came to light when several hundis were dishonored, leading to investigations and the filing of complaints.",

        "arguments": "*   **Sanction:** The appellants argued that the sanction was invalid. The court held that an official communication mentioning the Governor's sanction created a presumption of valid sanction, especially as it wasn't challenged in the lower courts. *   **Charge:** The court found the charge, while referencing multiple sections, clearly outlined the conspiracy to cheat and forge, and the appellants understood it. *   **Cheating:** The court analyzed the definition of \"dishonestly\" and \"fraudulently.\" It concluded that for Section 420 IPC, proof of either wrongful gain or wrongful loss was sufficient. Evidence showed the family firms made unlawful gains by obtaining credit on the security of forged documents, even if the banks weren't deprived of interest. The court found Lachhimi Narain, Tulsi Ram, and Beni Gopal guilty of cheating. Babu Lal's involvement in cheating was not sufficiently proven. *   **Conspiracy:** The court upheld the conspiracy charge against Lachhimi Narain, Tulsi Ram, and Beni Gopal, citing their involvement in cheating and other acts. Babu Lal and Moti Lal's conviction for conspiracy was also upheld based on their actions and their close familial ties to Lachhimi Narain. However, Chandrika Singh was acquitted of conspiracy as his actions were considered to be within the scope of his employment and not indicative of participation in the conspiracy. *   **Sentences:** Considering the time elapsed since the offenses (13 years prior), the age of the accused, and the fact that no actual monetary loss resulted to anyone, the court decided to reduce the sentences. Lachhimi Narain's sentence was reduced, and a higher fine was imposed. For the other appellants (Tulsi Ram, Beni Gopal, Babu Lal, and Moti Lal), their substantive sentences were reduced to the period already undergone, with a fine imposed.",

Section 6 applies to offenders under 21 *at the time the court is dealing with the offender and passing sentence*, not necessarily at the time of the offense. Since Ramji was found to be over 21 on the sentencing date by the Sessions Judge, Section 6 was inapplicable. *   **Basist's Case:** This was more complex. *   **Applicability of Section 6:** The Supreme Court found that Basist, being 19 at the time of the offense and potentially around 20 at the Sessions Judge's sentencing, was likely under 21.

These Regulations created Special Tribunals and then Special Judges, with specific procedures that differed from ordinary law. *   **Sanction:** Sanction to prosecute the appellant, a public officer, was obtained from the Military Governor. *   **Conviction:** The Special Judge convicted the appellant of all charges and sentenced him to death and imprisonment.",
        "issues": "*   **Validity of the Trial Procedure:** Whether the procedure for trial prescribed by Hyderabad Regulation X of 1359F became void under Article 13(1) of the Constitution (which voids pre-Constitution laws inconsistent with fundamental rights) due to its conflict with Article 14 (equal protection of laws). *   **Delegation of Authority:** Whether the delegation of authority by the Chief Minister to the Civil Administrator to make over cases for trial by the Special Judge was lawful. *   **Constitutional Challenge Grounds:** Specifically, whether the Regulation's exclusion of committal proceedings, replacement of sessions procedure with warrant procedure, denial of revision and transfer rights, and negation of the Nizam's confirmation of death sentences violated Article 14.",
        "arguments": "*   **Pre-Constitution Law and Article 14:** The Court noted that pre-Constitution laws remain valid for past transactions and accrued rights. Article 13(1) invalidates only inconsistent provisions, not the entire statute. The key question was whether the *procedure followed* after January 26, 1950, denied the accused the equal protection of laws. *   **Exclusion of Committal Proceedings/Warrant Procedure:** The Court, following precedent (Qasim Razvi's case), found this not to be a substantial deviation from ordinary law, as committal proceedings were not always compulsory under Hyderabad law, and the procedural differences were minor. *   **Rights of Revision and Transfer:** The Court interpreted Section 8 of the Regulation to mean that the right to apply for transfer was unaffected, and revision was denied only for non-appealable sentences. Since the current case involved appealable serious offenses, this was not a ground for invalidating the trial. *   **Confirmation of Death Sentence:** Section 8 of the Regulation was found to be invalid to the extent it took away the provision for confirmation of sentences (by the Nizam). However, this was considered a *severable* part. The trial and conviction were not affected by this omission; the right to confirmation could be asserted later. The procedure for confirmation itself was discussed but deferred to the merits of the appeal. *   **Delegation of Authority:** The Court held that delegating power to an officeholder by designation (e.g., Civil Administrator) was a proper and convenient method, complying with the Regulation. *   **Conclusion on Constitutional Points:** The Court concluded that the constitutional points raised did not prejudice the accused or invalidate the trial and conviction.",

The defense also suggested the alcohol could have been from medicinal preparations. *   **Majority Opinion (SHAH, J.):** *   Acknowledged defects in the prosecution's evidence regarding the chain of custody of the blood sample and the lack of examination of the special messenger. *   Ruled that while Section 129A prescribes a method for compelling examination, Section 129A(8) permits proof of intoxicant consumption otherwise. *   Distinguished the case from *Nazir Ahmed*, stating that Sections 129A and 129B do not exclusively define the method for proving alcohol concentration, and Section 510 of the Criminal Procedure Code can still apply. *   Found that the blood sample was collected at 6 am before any investigation commenced, thus not strictly under Section 129A, making its admissibility under Section 510 of the CrPC valid. *   However, due to procedural infirmities and the need for a \"fair and full trial,\" the Court set aside the Trial Magistrate's order and directed the Sessions Judge to hear the appeal and allow the prosecution to lead further evidence on the chain of custody and related matters. *   **Dissenting Opinion (DAS GUPTA, J.):** *   Argued that Section 66(2) provides a special right to the prosecution, and the detailed procedure in Section 129A was intended to be the *exclusive* mode for obtaining evidence to invoke this presumption. *   Interpreted Section 129A(8) as only saving other modes of proving *consumption*, not the proof of *alcoholic content* of the blood for the purpose of Section 66(2). *   Applied the principle of *expressio unius exclusio alterius*, concluding that the omission of a saving clause for proving alcohol content meant it must be proven strictly under Section 129A. *   Therefore, since the 6 am blood sample was not collected per Section 129A, the prosecution could not benefit from Section 66(2), and the appellant should be acquitted.",

        "arguments": "*   The sales were concluded in Calcutta where the property in the goods passed, making them outside the Madras province's taxing jurisdiction. *   Taxing these sales would be an extraterritorial operation, thus unconstitutional for the Provincial Legislature. *   The \"sale\" in the context of the Sales Tax Act refers to the transaction itself, not just the legal passing of property. *   The location of the business, accounting, and delivery to the common carrier in Madras was sufficient to deem the sale as taking place in Madras. *   The court first addressed the constitutional challenge and found it unsustainable. Citing Section 100(3) of the Government of India Act, 1935, and Entry 48 of the Provincial List, it held that while a provincial legislature cannot tax outside its territory, it can tax transactions outside if there's a sufficient territorial nexus. *   The court then focused on the interpretation of the Madras Sales Tax Act. It examined the title and preamble, which indicated the object was to tax sales *within* the Province of Madras. *   The definition of \"sale\" in Section 2(h) was crucial, emphasizing the \"transfer of property.\" The court noted that this definition did not adopt the \"popular meaning\" of sale as understood by the High Court. *   The court highlighted that specific explanations were added later (by Madras Act XXV of 1947) to create a legal fiction for sales taking place within the province even if the contract was made elsewhere or property passed outside. However, these explanations were *not* in operation during the period for which the tax was assessed. *   Therefore, based on the Act's provisions as they stood during the relevant period, the passing of property in goods outside the province meant the sale was not a sale *within* the Province of Madras for tax purposes. *   The court also noted the historical practice and the fact that tax was not levied on such transactions in previous years, nor were they taxed after the explanatory amendments came into force.",

They could exercise powers that would tend to facilitate obtaining confessions. *   Therefore, a confession made to such an Excise Officer during an investigation into an excise offense was deemed inadmissible, as it was akin to a confession made to a police officer. *   Additionally, statements made during an investigation by an Excise Officer were also inadmissible under Section 162 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (except for contradiction), further supporting the inadmissibility of the confession. **Dissenting (Dayal J.):** *   Dayal J. disagreed that the Excise Inspector was a \"police officer\" for the purposes of Section 25 of the Evidence Act. *   He relied heavily on the distinction made in the *Barkat Ram* case regarding Customs Officers, emphasizing that the primary purpose of the Excise Act was revenue collection, not crime detection in the same way as the police. *   He argued that while Excise Officers had certain powers similar to police officers, these were conferred for specific purposes and did not make them police officers in the broader sense. *   He pointed out that Section 85(3) of the Excise Act specifically states that certain Excise Officers are deemed police officers *for the purposes of the Criminal Procedure Code relating to arrests, searches, and seizures*, not for all purposes, including investigation. *   He argued that the deemed status of an Excise Officer as being in charge of a police station under Section 78(3) was *limited to the purposes of Section 156 Cr.P.C.* and did not extend to making them police officers under Section 25 of the Evidence Act. *   He also raised concerns about the voluntariness of the confession due to the alleged tampering of the seizure memo. *   Ultimately, even without deeming the confession inadmissible under Section 25, he found the evidence regarding the recovery of ganja unsatisfactory and doubted the voluntariness of the confession.",
        "decision": "The appeal was **allowed**. *   The conviction was set aside due to the inadmissibility of the confession and the unreliability of other evidence, including the tampered seizure memo. *   **Dayal J.**, while agreeing with the outcome, reached it by finding the evidence for the recovery of ganja unsatisfactory and doubting the voluntariness of the confession, rather than strictly on the interpretation of Section 25 of the Evidence Act. He concluded that Excise Officers were not police officers within the meaning of Section 25."

Munnalal admitted spending some money and giving some to the Executive Officer, with the remainder at his house. *   **Prosecution:** Initially charged under the Indian Penal Code, the case was later withdrawn and re-filed under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 (the Act). *   **Trials:** Munnalal faced multiple trials before a Special Judge, ultimately resulting in three appeals concerning specific sums of money. His brother, the Assistant Cashier, was acquitted. *   **Lower Courts:** The Special Judge found Munnalal guilty under Section 5(2) of the Act. The High Court upheld the conviction but reduced the sentences, acknowledging a practice of advancing funds to Board officials and the appellant not converting the money for personal use.",

The Court acknowledged the spirit of Section 5A might not have been followed but, referencing precedent (Rishbud & Inder Singh vs. State of Delhi), held that an illegal investigation doesn't vitiate a trial unless it causes a miscarriage of justice. The Court found no miscarriage of justice, especially given the appellant's partial admission and alternative defense. The case of *State of Madhya Pradesh vs. Mubarak Ali* was deemed not applicable as the objection was raised late in the present case. *   **Sanction for Prosecution:** The appellant argued that sanctions were insufficient for the split-up cases and for prosecution under Section 5(1)(c) of the Act. The Court ruled that the original sanction for the four cases covered the three split-up cases as they involved amounts within those original cases. Regarding Section 5(1)(c), the Court found that the sanction's language (referring to misappropriation and embezzlement) sufficiently encompassed the allegations made, including those under Section 5(1)(c). *   **Merits of Conviction and Sentence:** The appellant did not dispute his conviction but argued for a reduced sentence. He highlighted a prevalent practice within the Municipal Board where officials, including the Executive Officer, regularly took advances from the cash, leading to the inability to deposit funds as required. The Court recognized this \"scandalous state of affairs\" and the appellant's role in obliging these officers.",

        "arguments": "*   **Misjoinder:** The Court extensively analyzed Sections 233-239 of the Cr.P.C. The High Court's view that the clauses of Section 239 (joinder of persons) were mutually exclusive and could not be combined was rejected. The Supreme Court held that these clauses could be applied cumulatively to allow for joint trials when justified, aiming to prevent multiplicity of trials. The Court also emphasized that any procedural misjoinder would only lead to a conviction being set aside if it occasioned a \"failure of justice,\" a point the High Court had not adequately considered. *   **Conspiracy Charge:** The Court affirmed that a charge of criminal conspiracy is a distinct offense and can be laid even if the substantive offenses in furtherance of the conspiracy have been committed. The High Court's view that the conspiracy charge was invalid was overruled. *   **Approver's Evidence:** *   **Legality of Pardon:** The Court examined the grounds for challenging the pardon's legality (offenses not exclusively triable by Sessions Court, pardon granted by an unauthorized authority). It concluded that Section 409 IPC offenses were punishable with imprisonment up to 10 years, making them eligible for pardon. The authority of the Additional District Magistrate to grant pardon was also upheld, considering administrative orders and the general intent of the law. *   **Reliability of Evidence:** The Court found the High Court's assessment of the approver's evidence as \"unreliable\" by the Sessions Judge to be a misinterpretation. The Court stated that while an approver's evidence needs scrutiny and corroboration, the High Court should independently assess its credibility based on usual tests, not on a perceived unreliability by the lower court. *   **Admissibility of Evidence:** The Court clarified that while entries in account books are relevant (Section 34 Evidence Act), they are not sufficient alone to establish liability. However, the absence of entries in the books of recipient firms, coupled with testimony from their representatives, could be considered relevant under Section 11 of the Evidence Act to show non-payment. The High Court's exclusion of Gujarati account books due to lack of translation was also deemed incorrect. *   **Procedural Aspects:** The Court found the examination under Section 342 Cr.P.C. to be thorough, perhaps overly cautious, but not unfair or prejudicial, especially as the accused were represented by counsel. The failure to explicitly remind the accused of their right to give evidence under Section 342(4) was also deemed not to invalidate the proceedings.",

In this case, the assault on Tikam and the assault on Puran were distinct incidents, forming separate offenses with independent charges. The acquittal in the Puran case, primarily due to compounding of a lesser offense and lack of strong evidence for other charges, did not relate to the same facts or offenses as the Tikam case.

A statute is not retrospective simply because its requirements are drawn from a time antecedent to its passing. *   **Section 5(3) as Rule of Evidence:** The Court clarified that Section 5(3) is a rule of evidence, not a creation of a new offence. It provides an additional mode of proving criminal misconduct by establishing disproportionate assets and the inability to account for them. *   **Scope of Section 5(3):** The Court ruled that pecuniary resources and property acquired before the Act's commencement *must* be taken into account if they are in possession of the accused or on their behalf at the time of the complaint, regardless of acquisition date. *   **Evidence and Presumption:** The Court found that the evidence regarding assets held by Sajjan Singh and his son Bhupinder Singh (totaling over Rs. 1,20,000) was disproportionate to his known sources of income (estimated net income around Rs. 67,000 after expenses). The explanations for these assets were found untrustworthy. *   **\"Known Sources of Income\":** The Court stated this refers to sources known to the prosecution after thorough investigation. *   **Sentence:** The minimum sentence under Section 5(2) is one year, and no special reasons were found to reduce it.",

These payments were allegedly disguised in the contractors' account books.

        "arguments": "*   **Seizure:** The trial court doubted the seizure due to the prosecution's failure to examine witnesses listed in the seizure memo. The High Court believed the officer's testimony. The Supreme Court, after examining the evidence, including a defense witness's testimony which corroborated the search in the compartment and the finding of a pouch, found the seizure story credible. They reasoned that the absence of listed witnesses was likely due to them being \"gained over.\" *   **Authority to Seize:** The appellant argued that the officer lacked authority as the seizure location was not within the specifically designated districts in the notification. The Court interpreted the notification broadly, finding that officers appointed for \"areas adjoining the Land Customs Frontiers\" and \"within the jurisdiction of the Collector of Land Customs Delhi\" had authority over the entire expansive area under the Collector's purview, not just specific districts. Therefore, Lal Singh, being an officer from a listed district, had the authority. *   **Mens Rea:** The appellant argued that even if the gold was smuggled and Section 178A applied, the prosecution still needed to prove the appellant's intent to evade regulations. The Court held that the circumstances of the seizure – the quantity of gold, its form (bars and blocks), the concealment, and the appellant's position as a railway pointsman – overwhelmingly established that the appellant was carrying the gold knowingly and with the intent to evade import prohibitions.",

He stated she was pregnant and living with him when she was taken away by the police on June 23, 1960, while he was arrested on charges related to abduction and rape.

The Court hoped that if Mahesh were to renew the petition, the High Court would conduct a strict inquiry into the facts of age, conversion, and marriage.

        "arguments": "*   **Admissibility of statements:** *   Appellants argued their statements to customs were not properly proved. The Court found the statements were signed by the appellants and their lawyer, and the appellants admitted signing them, thus they were proved. *   Appellants argued statements to customs were inadmissible under Sections 24 and 25 of the Indian Evidence Act. The Court held customs officers are not police officers (Section 25 does not apply). While customs officers are persons in authority, the finding of lower courts that the statements were not made under inducement, threat, or promise meant Section 24 also did not render them inadmissible. *   **Effect of prior confiscation and penalty:** *   Appellants relied on Section 186 of the Act, suggesting that prior confiscation and penalty barred further criminal prosecution under the Act. *   The Court interpreted Section 186 as an **enabling** provision, allowing prosecutions under other laws even after action under the Act, not a **barring** provision. It was intended to permit prosecutions in addition to other penalties, not prevent them. The introduction of Section 167(81) made it possible to prosecute under the Act itself after confiscation. *   **Satisfying the ingredients of Section 167(81):** *   Appellants argued it wasn't proven they intended to defraud the government or evade restrictions. *   The Court reasoned that once it is proven the gold is smuggled, it inherently implies it was brought in without duty payment or in violation of restrictions. Anyone dealing with known smuggled gold with the intention to sell it would be presumed to have the intent to evade duty or violate restrictions as required by the section. *   **Sentence:** *   Appellants requested a reduction in sentence, noting they had served a portion and were on bail. *   The Court saw no reason to interfere with the sentence in such cases.",

The appellant alleges this false testimony led to him being heavily taxed. *   **Criminal Complaint:** The appellant filed a criminal complaint against Respondent No. 2 under Section 193 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) in Bombay. *   **Objection:** Respondent No. 2 raised a preliminary objection, arguing the Magistrate could not take cognizance of the complaint because the alleged false statement was made in a proceeding before the ITO, which he contended was a \"court\" under Section 195(1)(b) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Cr.P.C.). This section requires a complaint in writing from the \"court\" itself for such offenses.",

The absence of such express language in Section 37(4) suggests no such intention for the ITO. *   Section 37(4) makes proceedings before the ITO \"judicial proceedings\" under Section 193 IPC. *   The higher penalty under Section 193 IPC for offenses in \"judicial proceedings\" implies that these proceedings should attract the safeguard of Section 195(1)(b) Cr.P.C. (requiring a complaint from the court). *   Therefore, a proceeding that is \"judicial\" under Section 193 IPC should be considered a \"proceeding in any court\" for Section 195(1)(b) Cr.P.C. purposes. *   Interpreting Section 37(4) solely for the IPC punishment would create an anomaly: offenses in ITO proceedings are more serious but lack the procedural safeguard available for offenses in other courts. *   The fact that Section 37(4) also refers to Section 228 IPC (insulting a public servant sitting in a judicial proceeding) is significant. If an ITO is insulted during proceedings, it's now an offense punishable under Section 228 IPC. Under Section 195(1)(b) Cr.P.C., such an offense would normally require a complaint from the \"court\" (the ITO). It would be anomalous if offenses *against* the ITO during his proceedings were cognizable only on his complaint, but offenses *by* the ITO (like perjury) were not subject to the same court-complaint requirement. *   The reference to Section 228 IPC in Section 37(4) strengthens this view. Offenses under Section 228 IPC inherently require a complaint from the judicial officer. It would be anomalous if offenses committed by the ITO (perjury) were not subject to a similar \"court complaint\" requirement as offenses committed against the ITO. *   Therefore, Section 37(4) makes proceedings before the ITO judicial proceedings under Section 193 IPC, and these should be treated as proceedings in any court for the purpose of Section 195(1)(b) Cr.P.C. *   An ITO's primary function is administrative; while they exercise powers similar to a court under the Code of Civil Procedure for certain matters, this doesn't convert them into a \"court\" or a limb of the judicial organ. They are quasi-judicial authorities. *   The anomaly described by the majority is not sufficient reason to interpret the statute beyond its plain wording.",

        "arguments": "*   **Competency of Special Court:** The Court reasoned that Section 4 of the Act allows Special Courts to try scheduled offences (like Section 409 IPC) and, by proviso, can also try other offences that the accused could be charged with at the same trial under the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr. P.C.). Section 4 also lists Section 420 IPC as a scheduled offence if committed by a public servant while purporting to act as such. The appellant, as a clerk, was a public servant and presented the false bill while purporting to act in his official capacity. Therefore, the Special Court had jurisdiction to try Section 420 IPC. *   **Alteration of Conviction:** The Court relied on Sections 236 and 237 of the Cr. P.C. Section 236 allows charging multiple offences if it's doubtful which offence the facts constitute. Section 237 allows conviction for an offence not specifically charged if the evidence supports it and it could have been charged under Section 236.

This burden is no higher than in civil proceedings. *   **Burden of Proof:** The Court clarified that the accused must present evidence that makes the existence of insanity probable enough for a \"prudent man\" to act upon. Even if the insanity defence isn't conclusively proven, the evidence presented could raise a reasonable doubt about the necessary *mens rea* (criminal intent) required for murder, leading to acquittal. *   **Merits of Insanity Plea:** *   **Motive:** Evidence suggested the appellant disliked his wife and had asked his father-in-law to take her away. The murder occurred around the time the father-in-law was expected. *   **Previous History:** The Court found no credible evidence of a history of insanity. Witnesses claiming prior fits of insanity were deemed unreliable as their earlier police statements contradicted this and other evidence suggested his functioning was normal. An affidavit filed for medical treatment also did not mention a history of insanity. *   **During the Incident:** Witnesses who claimed the appellant was acting madly after the incident were disbelieved because their earlier statements to the police indicated he admitted to the murder and behaved sanely when questioned by the police inspector. *   **Subsequent Events:** The appellant's willingness to confess (though later withdrawn), the lack of mention of insanity in medical certificates, and his ability to understand proceedings at later stages were inconsistent with a genuine defence of insanity at the time of the offence.",
        "decision": "The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal. It held that the appellant had failed to prove that he was suffering from insanity at the time of the murder as defined by Section 84 of the Indian Penal Code. The evidence did not establish that he was incapable of knowing the nature of his act or that it was wrong or contrary to law. Furthermore, the evidence did not even raise a reasonable doubt regarding the *mens rea* for murder. Therefore, the conviction and sentence were upheld."

        "issues": "*   **Identity:** Was the appellant the same person (Ibrahim, son of Miru) who was deported in April 1957? *   **\"Foreigner\" Status:** Did the amendment to the definition of \"foreigner\" in the Foreigners Act (effective January 19, 1957) affect the case, particularly if the appellant entered India before that date? *   **Jurisdiction:** Did the court have jurisdiction to determine if the appellant was a \"foreigner,\" or was this determination barred by Section 9(2) of the Act?",
        "arguments": "*   **Identity:** The prosecution presented two witnesses (police officials) who identified the appellant as the person deported. The court found these witnesses credible, noting they were public servants with no apparent reason to depose falsely. Documentary evidence also supported the deportation of an \"Ibrahim, son of Miru.\" A minor discrepancy in the spelling of the father's name was dismissed as a possible transliteration error. *   **\"Foreigner\" Status:** The court reasoned that the crucial factor was the appellant's status at the time of his illegal re-entry. Since he was deported in April 1957, any re-entry must have occurred after that date. By April 1957, the definition of \"foreigner\" had been amended to include Pakistani citizens. Therefore, he was a foreigner upon re-entry without a valid passport. *   **Jurisdiction:** The court clarified that Section 9(2) of the Act places the onus on the accused to prove they are *not* a foreigner. In this case, after the identity was established, the appellant was presumed to be a foreigner, and the prosecution's case was about his re-entry without valid documents after deportation, not about losing Indian citizenship. Thus, Section 9(2) was not a bar to the court's jurisdiction.",

The court proceeded with the remaining eight appeals. *   The core of the dispute was whether the forest areas in question were \"reserved forests\" under the Indian Forest Act. *   These areas were known as Garjichhera reserve, Chandrapur reserve, and North Sonamura reserve.",
        "issues": "*   The court also briefly touched upon whether a conviction under Section 26(1)(a) of the Indian Forest Act was sustainable without a specific notification under Section 4 of the Act.",
        "arguments": "*   The court analyzed the scheme of the Indian Forest Act, particularly Chapter II (Reserved Forests) and Chapter IV (Protected Forests). *   Chapter II of the Indian Act involves a rigorous procedure of inquiry, extinguishment of rights, and a final notification under Section 20 to constitute a \"reserved forest.\" The entire forest area is protected. *   Chapter IV deals with \"protected forests,\" where specific trees or areas are protected, and rights might be suspended for a period. The object is often the protection of specific trees or forest produce. *   The Tripura Forest Act primarily focused on protecting specific types of trees and had provisions for defining boundaries and prohibiting certain activities like 'Jhum' cultivation and cutting trees. *   The court found that the Tripura Act's object and provisions aligned more closely with the concept of \"protected forests\" under Chapter IV of the Indian Forest Act, rather than the comprehensive \"reserved forests\" under Chapter II. *   The proviso in the Part C States (Laws) Act was interpreted to mean that actions under the repealed law would be deemed done under the *corresponding* provision of the extended law. Since the Tripura Act corresponded to Chapter IV (Protected Forests), the notifications were deemed to be for protected forests, not reserved forests. *   The court noted that Section 26(1)(a) of the Indian Act required a notification under Section 4, which was absent.",
        "decision": "*   The Supreme Court held that the forest areas in question, notified under the old Tripura Forest Act, were not constituted as \"reserved forests\" under Chapter II of the Indian Forest Act, 1927. *   Instead, the notifications under the Tripura Act corresponded to the provisions for \"protected forests\" under Chapter IV of the Indian Forest Act. *   Since the prosecution was for offenses under Section 26, which applies to \"reserved forests,\" and the areas were not legally declared as such under the relevant provisions of the Indian Act, the respondents could not be held guilty of the charges as framed. *   Therefore, the acquittals ordered by the Judicial Commissioner were upheld. *   The appeals filed by the Union of India were dismissed."

        "arguments": "*   The prosecution failed to produce three material witnesses, prejudicing the defense. *   Evidence from partisan witnesses should be discarded. *   The uniform pattern of witness testimony without assigning specific roles indicated unreliability. *   The High Court's test for conviction (requiring at least four consistent witnesses) was mechanical. *   Mere presence in an unlawful assembly without overt acts is insufficient for conviction (relying on *Baladin vs. State of Uttar Pradesh*). *   The death sentence should only be imposed if the accused personally committed the murder, not just by virtue of being in an unlawful assembly (relying on *Dalip Singh vs. State of Punjab*).",

        "issues": "*   Can an appellate court or High Court, exercising powers under Section 11 of the Juvenile Offenders Act, 1958, make an order under Section 6 of the Act in respect of an offender convicted before the Act came into force in that jurisdiction? *   Does the Act have retrospective application to such cases?",
        "arguments": "*   The Act represents a reform in penology, focusing on individual reformation. *   Section 11(1) of the Act broadly empowers any court, including appellate and revisional courts, to make orders under the Act when a case comes before them. *   This power is not limited to situations where the trial court could have made such an order. The Act's purpose of social reform suggests a comprehensive application. *   Interpreting Section 6 along with Section 11(1) means that an appellate or revisional court, when finding an accused guilty (either by confirming a conviction or convicting on appeal from acquittal), is bound by the conditions of Section 6. *   The phrase \"the court by which the person is found guilty\" includes appellate and revisional courts. *   Appellate and revisional courts can only exercise powers in cases where the trial court could have acted. Since the Act was not in force when the appellant was convicted, the trial court had no power to act under it. *   There is no express or implied provision in the Act making it retrospective for cases decided before its enforcement. *   Allowing the Act to apply retrospectively in this manner would create significant anomalies and reopen numerous past cases, which the legislature likely did not intend without clearer language. *   The phrase \"the Court by which the person is found guilty\" primarily refers to the trial court. While Section 11(1) allows appellate/revisional courts to make orders, it's in cases where the trial court *could have* made such an order. *   The case of Ramji Missar was distinguishable as the trial court *could* have made an order under the Act, but didn't due to the nature of the offense as determined by it, whereas in this case, the trial court *could not* have made an order at all.",
        "decision": "*   The mandatory requirement of calling for a probation officer's report under Section 6(2) is a condition precedent. *   The lower courts overlooked the mandatory provisions of the Act, despite it being recently extended to the area, making interference under Article 136 justified.

The Court held that the High Court, and by extension the Supreme Court, could exercise powers under Section 6 of the Juvenile Offenders Act, 1958, even if the conviction occurred before the Act's extension to the relevant jurisdiction, provided the case was before it on appeal or revision and the offender was under 21. The Court **set aside the order of the High Court** and **directed it to make an order under Section 6 of the Act**, or to remand the case to the Sessions Court for doing so, ensuring compliance with Section 6(2) (calling for a probation officer's report)."

        "arguments": "*   **Circumstantial Evidence:** The High Court identified several circumstances pointing to Sahoo's guilt: illicit relations with the deceased, a quarrel before the incident, the deceased being seen alive with Sahoo that night, all three sleeping in the same room, Sahoo's son hearing sounds and seeing Sahoo leave the house, and other witnesses seeing Sahoo leave and hearing his soliloquy. *   The Court examined the definition of \"confession\" under the Evidence Act, noting it's not explicitly defined. *   It referred to established definitions that require admitting an offense or substantially all its constituent facts. *   The Court reasoned that \"statement\" is a genus, and \"confession\" is a species. A statement doesn't inherently require communication to another to be valid. *   Citing legal authorities and a previous Supreme Court case, the Court concluded that a statement admitting guilt, even if not communicated to another (like a written confession in a diary or an oral soliloquy), is a confession. *   However, the Court stressed that such confessions, especially soliloquies, are direct evidence but require careful scrutiny. They should not be the sole basis for conviction and are best used as corroborative evidence. *   **Weight of Evidence:** The Court found that while a soliloquy can be confusing, the witnesses in this case clearly heard Sahoo's words.

The appellant failed to provide evidence that it was unfit for intoxicating use. *   **Irrelevant Evidence:** The appellant claimed the High Court considered irrelevant evidence.

        "issues": "",
        "arguments": "*   Section 259 applies to arrears \"recoverable by a Board or a Military Estates Officer under this Act or the rules made thereunder.\" *   This wording implies that the rent must be *claimable* by the Board under the Act or rules, not just arising from a contractual lease. *   While the Act and Rules (e.g., Section 116, 116A, Property Rules, Land Administration Rules) grant the Board power to manage and lease property, the right to claim rent arises from the lease contract itself, not directly from these general provisions. *   However, the Court acknowledged that the 1954 amendment adding \"rent on land and buildings\" suggests legislative intent for such recovery. *   The Court found examples where the Act *does* provide for the Board to claim rent (e.g., under Section 257, where the Board can intercept rent from an occupier to recover expenses from the owner). *   Therefore, Section 259 applies when the Act or Rules *expressly* make rent claimable by the Board, not just when rent arises from a private lease agreement. In this case, the rent was purely contractual. *   The existence of a suit as an alternative recovery method under Section 259 doesn't negate the interpretation that the magistrate's power is limited to rent claimable under the Act/Rules. *   **Dissenting Opinion (Mudholkar J.):** *   Argued that the phrase \"recoverable by a Board... under this Act or the rules made thereunder\" should be interpreted broadly. *   The Board's power to lease and collect rent stems directly from the Act and Rules. Therefore, rent collected due to the exercise of these powers is \"recoverable under the Act.\" *   A narrow interpretation would render the word \"rent\" in Section 259 otiose, as there are no provisions in the Act *expressly* stating rent is claimable by the Board outside of contractual leases. *   Cited a case (Tideway Investment) where a claim arising from a lease was treated as arising \"under\" a statute due to the defence raised. *   The repeal of Rule 42 (which explicitly allowed recovery under Section 259) might have been because the language of Section 259 was considered sufficient. *   Interpreting Section 257 as the only example of the Board claiming rent is too restrictive.",

Such an order does not put the accused in jeopardy in a way that bars a subsequent trial. *   The prior judge (Mr. Ganguly), despite framing a charge, concluded he lacked jurisdiction.

        "arguments": "*   **Majority Opinion (Wanchoo, Shah, Sikri, Pamaswami JJ.):** *   Interpreted Section 167(81) broadly. *   Argued that the provision is intended to prevent smuggling and should not have a \"lacuna\" that allows subsequent dealers of smuggled goods to escape punishment. *   Stated that the \"intent to evade prohibition or restriction\" or \"intent to defraud the government\" can be inferred even if the person was not involved in the *actual* act of smuggling, as long as they knowingly deal with prohibited/undutiable goods *while the prohibition/restriction is still in force or duty remains unpaid*. *   Emphasized that the prohibition/restriction doesn't end once goods cross the customs barrier; it continues as long as the goods are prohibited. *   Drew parallels with English case law, which similarly interpreted analogous provisions to include subsequent dealers. *   Found that Sitaram Agarwala's attempt to purchase the gold, based on a prior arrangement, constituted being \"concerned in dealing with\" prohibited goods, and he possessed the necessary intent. *   Found the Chinese accused also guilty of dealing with prohibited goods with the requisite intent. *   **Dissenting Opinion (Subba Rao J.):** *   Advocated for a strict construction of penal statutes. *   Argued that the \"knowledge\" and \"intent\" elements of Section 167(81) are distinct and must both be proven. *   Contended that a person knowingly purchasing smuggled goods *after* import cannot have the \"intent to evade a provision against import\" because the import has already occurred. Their intent might be to *receive* stolen goods, not to *commit the theft*. *   Believed that attributing the intent to evade import to subsequent purchasers would be incongruous and could lead to anomalies. *   Stated that the Legislature, not the court, should fill any gaps (casus omissus).",

There was no evidence that the alcohol content exceeded the permissible limits for distillation under the main part of Section 59A. *   The crucial factor was the amended Section 6A, specifically sub-section (7).

The court suggested that the conjunction \"or\" should be interpreted as \"and\" in this context to avoid anomalous consequences. *   **Purpose of the Coke Plant:** The respondent's plant manufactured coke, a by-product, and did not engage in coal excavation. Therefore, it was argued it was not an \"excavation where any operation for the purpose of obtaining coal has been or is being carried on.\" *   **Subsequent Amendments:** The court referred to a later amendment (Coal Mines Provident Fund and Bonus Schemes (Amendment) Act, 1965) that expanded the definition of \"coal mine.\" However, the court stated this amendment was intended to clarify rather than change the law, reinforcing their interpretation of the original Act. *   **Ownership and Control:** The respondent owned the coke plant and leased the land, but did not own or operate the actual coal mine.

Therefore, it does not affect personal liberty. *   While an arrested person has the right to take steps against the arrest through a legal practitioner, the Act itself is not invalid simply because the individuals were arrested under a different law (Cr.P.C.) and tried under the Act. *   The validity of an Act depends on its terms, not on the particular facts of a case (like the respondents being arrested). *   The respondents were not under arrest during the trial (having been released on bonds) and their trial before the Nyaya Panchayat did not involve the risk of losing personal liberty. *   Therefore, Section 63 does not violate Article 22(1) in the context of the Nyaya Panchayat's powers. **Dissenting Opinion (Hidayatullah J.):** *   Article 22(1) grants three rights to arrested persons: to be informed of arrest grounds, to consult a legal practitioner, and to be defended by a legal practitioner. *   The right to be defended by a legal practitioner should not cease upon release on bail; it continues as long as the effects of the arrest persist and the person is answering a charge. *   The historical context of the right to counsel suggests it is a fundamental aspect of justice, not a mere procedural formality. *   Denying a person the right to counsel in any trial that may result in a penalty (even a fine) is a violation of the spirit of Article 22(1). *   The Nyaya Panchayat Act, by prohibiting legal practitioners, infringes upon this fundamental right. *   Therefore, Section 63 is void due to its inconsistency with Article 22(1). *   Article 22(1) applies to \"any person who is arrested\" and guarantees the right to consult and be defended by a legal practitioner. *   This right attaches upon arrest, even if the person is later released on bail. *   The Nyaya Panchayat has no power to impose imprisonment. *   However, the respondents never requested legal representation during the trial, nor did they claim prejudice.

        "arguments": "*   **Distinction between Sections 193 and 218 IPC:** *   **Section 193 IPC:** Punishes giving false evidence or fabricating false evidence for use in a judicial proceeding, with the intent to cause an erroneous opinion. *   **Section 218 IPC:** Deals with public servants intentionally preparing a false record to save or injure any person or property. This doesn't necessarily relate to a judicial proceeding. *   **Application of Section 195 CrPC:** This section bars cognizance of offences under Section 193 IPC unless initiated by a written complaint from the Court where the offence occurred. *   **The Ahlmad's Case:** The Court found that the Ahlmad's alleged act of making a false, ante-dated entry in the Jamabandi register was intended for use in a judicial proceeding to create an erroneous opinion about the date. This squarely falls under Section 192 IPC (fabricating false evidence), which is punishable under Section 193 IPC. Therefore, the bar of Section 195 CrPC applied, and the High Court was correct in quashing proceedings against the Ahlmad and his abettor (Harinath Singh) in this specific instance. *   **The Lekhpals' Cases:** The Court reasoned that the Lekhpals' alleged act of creating false entries in the Khasra was done with the intent to save the property from the vendees. This falls under Section 218 IPC, as the primary intention was to injure the purchasers by falsifying records concerning property. This offence is distinct from Section 192/193 IPC. Since Section 218 IPC is not listed in Section 195 CrPC, a private complaint is permissible.

A Magistrate convicted some and acquitted others. The 11 respondents were convicted under Section 20(1)(c) and 21(b) and/or 21(c) of the Act. *   **Sessions Court:** The Sessions Judge upheld convictions for some, altered a conviction from Section 20(1)(c) to 20(1)(b) for others, and maintained convictions for the rest. *   **High Court:** In revision, the High Court acquitted all accused, ruling that the contracts were non-transferable specific delivery contracts and not prohibited by the Act. *   **Respondents:** The respondents are members of the Ghee and Tel Brokers Association Ltd., Ahmedabad, with some being Directors, President, and Secretary. *   **Prosecution Allegation:** The Association facilitated speculative forward contracts for groundnut oil, which were largely settled by adjusting losses rather than actual delivery. These were alleged to be prohibited forward contracts due to the lack of actual delivery and the Association not being recognized under the Act.",

        "arguments": "*   **The Act's Provisions:** The Court examined definitions of \"forward contract,\" \"ready delivery contract,\" and \"specific delivery contract.\" It focused on Section 18(1) and its proviso, which prohibits unrecognised associations from facilitating the performance of specific delivery contracts without actual delivery. Sections 20 and 21 outline penalties for contravening these provisions. *   **Analysis of Transactions:** The Court found that the vast majority of transactions (over 98%) involved no actual delivery, with contracts being settled through cross-transactions and adjustments of losses. This indicated a lack of intent to perform the contracts as true delivery contracts. *   **Section 18(1) Proviso:** The Court found that the Association, being unrecognised, provided facilities for settling contracts without actual delivery, directly contravening the proviso to Section 18(1). *   **Magistrate vs. Sessions Judge:** The Magistrate was found to have erred in his interpretation of Section 18(1) and its proviso.

They did not wait for the proper legal channels or the end of the voyage to resolve the dispute. *   **Reasonable Cause:** The court reasoned that even if the conduct fell under the \"reasonable cause\" provision, there was no sufficient justification. The dispute was a quantifiable monetary claim, and legal mechanisms existed to resolve it through the Shipping Master or at the company's registered office. The seamen's actions were seen as using a \"weapon of strike\" to force immediate compliance, which is not considered reasonable cause for abandoning their duties. *   **Policy of the Act:** The court emphasized the importance of discipline in shipping and the paramountcy of crew duties.

The prosecution must prove a direct nexus between the rash/negligent act and the death.

The Court, referencing Privy Council precedent, held that while it's desirable to specify facts, it's not essential if those facts were indeed placed before the sanctioning authority. The letter from the District Magistrate requesting sanction clearly outlined the information received about bribery and the recovery of marked currency, thereby validating the sanction for the offense charged (which was confined to Section 5(1)(a)). *   **Presumption under Section 5(3):** The Court explained that Section 5(3) creates a rule of evidence: if a public servant possesses resources disproportionate to their known income and cannot satisfactorily account for them, the court *shall* presume guilt for criminal misconduct. The appellant was found with a significant sum (Rs. 2,698 unexplained), and his salary and allowances were much lower. Both lower courts found his explanation for the excess money unsatisfactory. This failure to account satisfactorily for disproportionate wealth triggered the presumption under Section 5(3). *   **Particulars in Charge:** The Court ruled that the charge under Section 5(1)(a) is of a general character and doesn't require individual instances of bribe-taking like Section 161 IPC. The presumption under Section 5(3) further reduces the need for such particulars. The appellant was not prejudiced as he knew the case against him and had an opportunity to present his defense.",
        "decision": "*   The Supreme Court upheld the appellant's conviction for criminal misconduct under Section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act. *   The sanction for prosecution was deemed valid because the facts forming the basis of the offense were placed before the sanctioning authority, as evidenced by the District Magistrate's letter. *   The presumption of guilt under Section 5(3) was correctly applied because the appellant was found in possession of pecuniary resources disproportionate to his known sources of income, and he could not satisfactorily account for them. *   The charge was not invalid due to a lack of particulars, as the nature of the offense and the presumption under Section 5(3) did not necessitate detailed enumeration of every instance. *   The appeal was dismissed."

The prosecution argued that: *   Ethyl Wong was not an \"accused person\" at the time of her examination, as she was not on trial, and Section 132 of the Indian Evidence Act protected her from self-incrimination by compelling her to testify. *   She was a competent witness under Section 118 of the Indian Evidence Act, and her evidence, as an accomplice, was admissible under Section 133 of the Evidence Act, though it required corroboration. *   The prohibition in Section 5 of the Oaths Act applied only to persons actually *on trial* as accused, not to those questioned as witnesses who might have been involved. *   Photostat copies of documents were admissible due to the suppression of originals by the accused. *   While showing photographs prior to identification is problematic, other evidence corroborated Ethyl Wong's testimony and identification. *   The use of accomplice evidence, even outside specific pardon provisions, was permissible and did not violate constitutional rights.

The Court held that: *   **Ethyl Wong was a competent witness:** She was not an \"accused person\" at the time of her examination in the trial. Section 132 of the Indian Evidence Act provided sufficient protection, and therefore, an oath could be administered to her. Her evidence, as an accomplice, was admissible, though it required corroboration, which was found to be present. *   **The trial was not vitiated:** The prosecution was not obligated to prosecute Ethyl Wong. Using her as an accomplice witness, when she was not formally accused or on trial, was permissible and did not violate Article 14. *   **Photostat copies were admissible:** Given the suppression of originals by the appellants, photostat copies were acceptable evidence, especially for proving handwriting and contents of documents, with sufficient safeguards. *   **Identification was acceptable:** While showing photographs beforehand was not ideal, other corroborating evidence sufficiently identified the suspects. *   **Sentences were upheld:** The court found no reason to interfere with the sentences, acknowledging the severity of gold smuggling as an international crime.

While there was an initial misunderstanding about obtaining separate permissions for laying a trap and for further investigation, a single permission under Section 5A of the Prevention of Corruption Act covers the entire investigation, including trap laying. The court noted that while the magistrate's order for sanction was casual and lacked reasons, this illegality did not vitiate the trial unless prejudice was shown, which it wasn't. *   **Section 4 of the Prevention of Corruption Act:** The court held that the presumption under Section 4 arises when an accused receives a gratification (other than legal remuneration) or a valuable thing. \"Gratification\" should be interpreted literally as satisfaction, not necessarily meaning a bribe. The burden is on the accused to prove the contrary, and a mere plausible explanation is insufficient; the explanation must be shown to be true, though not necessarily beyond reasonable doubt. The appellant's explanation was not accepted by the lower courts. *   **Validity of Sanction:** The court found the sanction invalid. While the appellant was a Class III officer and not gazetted, and PW 1 (Chief Medical Officer) was the head of his department, the evidence did not show that PW 1 was the authority competent to remove a Class III officer from service.

        "decision": "*   The Court held that the acquittal of Harihar Gope did not affect the conviction of the appellants under Section 302 read with Section 149 IPC. *   The appellants were members of an unlawful assembly whose common object led to Budhia's death, and they were aware that such serious injuries were likely to be caused. *   Therefore, the conviction of the appellants for murder under Section 302 read with Section 149 IPC was legally sound. *   The appeal was dismissed."

They also contended that adaptations made to other laws implied the Fugitive Offenders Act remained alive. *   **Respondent (The Menons):** Argued that the Act, particularly Part II, was discriminatory and inconsistent with the Indian Constitution, specifically Article 14 (equal protection of laws). They also contended that India, as a sovereign republic, could not be considered a \"British Possession\" and therefore could not be grouped under Part II of the Act by an Order in Council. *   The Fugitive Offenders Act, 1881, was enacted by the British Parliament and divided into parts with different procedures for surrendering fugitives. *   Part II, which applied to groups of contiguous British Possessions, allowed for a summary surrender procedure without requiring a prima facie case, based on Orders in Council. *   After India became a sovereign republic, it ceased to be a \"British Possession.\" Therefore, it could no longer be grouped with other British Possessions under Part II of the Act by an Order in Council. *   Article 372 could not save the Act because the fundamental premise of its applicability (India being a British Possession) had changed.

However, the High Court, under Section 423(1)(b) (as amended), *can* enhance sentences if the accused is given an opportunity to show cause. *   In appeals against **acquittal** (under Section 423(1)(a)), the matter is \"at large.\" The High Court is empowered to \"pass a sentence on him according to law.\" This means the High Court can impose any sentence that the trial court was competent to impose. *   The court reasoned that allowing the High Court's power to be limited by the trial court's sentence when hearing an appeal against acquittal would create an anomalous situation where an acquittal by a higher court (Sessions Judge) could paradoxically restrict the High Court's sentencing power compared to a direct appeal from a Magistrate's conviction. *   The Court reviewed various precedents, noting a general principle that appellate power is often measured by the trial court's power, but distinguished the case of appeals against acquittal. *   **On Show Cause Notice:** *   In appeals against acquittal, when the accused is participating in the appeal hearing, the absence of a specific \"show cause\" notice for enhancement within the trial court's competence is not a violation of natural justice, as the accused is aware that the High Court will determine the appropriate sentence within its jurisdiction. *   The requirement for a show cause notice is more pronounced in revisionary powers or when the appeal is against a conviction, where the original sentence provides a baseline.",

Mehta on a railway train in Bombay on November 9, 1965. *   **Initial Conviction:** The appellant and one other accused (accused No. 3) were convicted of theft under Section 379/34 of the Indian Penal Code and sentenced to 12 months' rigorous imprisonment. One co-accused was acquitted. *   **High Court Appeal:** The appellant's conviction was altered by the High Court to one under Section 411 (receiving stolen property) with a reduced sentence of nine months' rigorous imprisonment. *   **Supreme Court Appeal:** The appellant appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that a statement made to the police was false and that no new facts were discovered as a result of this statement, making it inadmissible under Section 27 of the Evidence Act. *   **Prosecution's Case:** The victim's pocket was picked on a crowded train. He and his companion apprehended two individuals (accused 2 and 3). After the victim lodged a complaint and identified photos, the police investigated. The appellant was arrested the next day. A newspaper advertisement manager reported that two individuals, including accused No. 3, had inquired about placing an ad regarding the recovery of diamonds. The appellant then allegedly made a statement pointing to accused No. 3 as the recipient of the diamonds, leading to the recovery of 211 diamonds from accused No. 3.",
        "issues": "*   **Discovery of Fact:** Did the appellant's statement lead to the discovery of a new fact connecting him to the crime, or was the information already known to the police?",
        "arguments": "*   **Section 27 of the Evidence Act:** The court analyzed Section 27, which allows admissibility of information given by an accused that leads to the discovery of a fact, even if it's confessional, provided it distinctly relates to the discovered fact. *   **\"Discovery of Fact\":** The court emphasized that the \"fact discovered\" must be something previously unknown to the police and directly resulting from the accused's information. It is not just the recovery of stolen property but the discovery of a fact proving the accused's knowledge or connection to it. *   **Contradictory Testimonies:** The court found Gaud's testimony less credible compared to Pawri's and Mokashi's. Pawri's detailed account of the interaction with accused No. 3 and D.S. Parekh, including offering to hand over diamonds and providing documentation, suggested that the police likely learned about the diamonds being with accused No. 3 *before* the appellant's statement. *   **Implication:** If the police already knew that accused No. 3 possessed the diamonds, then the appellant's statement merely led to the discovery of accused No. 3's whereabouts, not a new fact proving the appellant's complicity in the theft or receiving the stolen goods.",
        "decision": "*   **Statement Inadmissible:** The court held that the appellant's statement was inadmissible under Section 27 of the Evidence Act because the police already possessed knowledge of the diamonds being with accused No. 3. Therefore, there was no \"discovery of a fact\" in consequence of the appellant's information. *   **No Discovery of Fact:** The discovery was limited to the whereabouts of accused No. 3, not a fact that proved the appellant's connection to the commission of the crime or the receipt of stolen property. *   **Appeal Allowed:** The appeal was allowed. The appellant was to be set at liberty."

        "arguments": "*   If there's other evidence connecting an accused to a crime, finding stolen property with them strengthens that evidence, rather than requiring a presumption. *   When possession of stolen property is the *only* link to the crime, a presumption can be drawn. *   The strength of this presumption depends on the circumstances, particularly the time gap between the crime and the discovery of the stolen property. A shorter gap strengthens the presumption of direct involvement. *   In this case, a large quantity of identical stolen goods was found with the appellants shortly after the dacoity (within days, in most cases). This made it highly improbable that they were merely receivers of stolen property from other dacoits. The disposal of such a large quantity of specific goods in such a short time was considered implausible. *   The fact that a large number of people (around 20) were involved in the dacoity, and significant portions of the stolen goods were found with a similar number of individuals, further supported the conclusion that these individuals were the dacoits themselves.",
        "decision": "*   The Court held that the presumption drawn by the lower courts, that the appellants were the dacoits, was correct and justified by the circumstances. *   However, the Court reduced the sentence from 5 years rigorous imprisonment to **3 years rigorous imprisonment**, finding the original sentence too severe given that no serious injury was caused beyond one instance. *   The fine imposed was to stand. *   The appeal was **partly allowed** to the extent of modifying the sentence."

        "arguments": "*   **Section 162 CrPC (Identification Parades):** *   The Court examined the conflict between High Courts on whether identification parades are \"statements\" under Section 162 CrPC. *   The majority view (approved by the Supreme Court) was that the act of identification by a witness to the police or panch witnesses constitutes a \"statement\" within the meaning of Section 162, and evidence of such identification conducted under police supervision is inadmissible. *   Identification parades held before August 1, 1951, were governed by the City of Bombay Police Act, 1902, and not Section 162 CrPC. Parades held after this date were subject to Section 162 CrPC. *   The Court found that identification parades for Accused 4, held after August 1, 1951, were inadmissible. *   **Section 27 IEA (Discoveries from Accused):** *   The defense argued that statements leading to discoveries of weapons and cash were inadmissible if not explicitly proven as per Section 27. *   The Court distinguished between the police officer stating *that* a discovery was made *in consequence of* information from the accused, and the police officer proving *the actual information* given by the accused. *   The Court held that the police officer stating a discovery was made \"in consequence of\" or \"at the instance of\" the accused, without revealing the actual statement, does not necessarily attract Section 27 and might be admissible as a link in the chain of evidence. However, the Court noted a potential for prejudice and reserved opinion on a Bombay High Court ruling to the contrary. *   In this case, even if the specific wording of statements leading to discovery was excluded, other admissible evidence supported the prosecution's case. *   **Misdirection/Non-direction in Judge's Charge:** *   The defense argued the judge's charge was unfair, biased, and failed to adequately present points favorable to the accused. *   The Court reviewed the charge meticulously and found it to be scrupulously fair, pointing out defects and contradictions in prosecution evidence and properly presenting the case to the jury. The Court found no \"gross misdescription\" or failure of justice. *   **Effect of Inadmissible Evidence/Misdirection:** *   The Court applied Sections 537 CrPC and 167 IEA, which state that convictions should not be set aside for errors unless they have *actually occasioned a failure of justice*. *   The Court held the power to examine the evidence itself to determine if the jury's verdict was justified, even after excluding inadmissible evidence.",

        "decision": "*   Appellants were charged with murder (Section 302 IPC) and causing hurt (Section 323 IPC) with common intention (Section 34 IPC). *   The deceased, Amarji, was attacked and killed by the accused. Vaghji Mansangji was also assaulted. *   A prior incident two months earlier between the families of Accused No. 2 and Vaghji Mansangji had led to a dispute, causing Accused No. 2 to leave his village. *   The prosecution alleged the accused lay in wait for Amarji and Vaghji's group as they returned from a village. *   Accused 1 and 2 allegedly inflicted knife blows on Amarji, while Accused 3 prevented one of the witnesses from intervening. *   The accused then attacked Vaghji, though the prosecution suggested this was a mistaken target for Amarji. *   The injured were taken to Khedoi hospital, where Amarji was found dead. *   The Sessions Court acquitted the accused of murder but convicted them under Section 304 Part II (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) and Section 323. *   The Gujarat High Court, due to a divided opinion between two judges, referred the case to a third judge (Mehta, J.) under Section 429 CrPC. *   Mehta, J. convicted Accused 1 of murder (Section 302 IPC) and Accused 2 and 3 of murder read with Section 34 IPC, ordering life imprisonment. *   **On Common Intention:** The court found that the evidence clearly indicated a concerted attack based on a pre-arranged plan. The sudden appearance of all three accused, their coordinated actions (attacking Amarji, preventing intervention, and then attacking Vaghji), and the use of weapons strongly suggested a common intention. *   **Mistake as to Victim:** The court ruled that a mistake in identifying the victim does not negate common intention if the evidence shows a pre-arranged plan and participation in furtherance of that plan. The act of killing Amarji was considered to be done in furtherance of the common intention to commit an offense, even if the specific target was mistaken. The principle of joint liability under Section 34 IPC was applied. *   The appeal is dismissed. *   The court held that there was sufficient evidence to establish a common intention to commit murder among all three accused, acting in furtherance of a pre-arranged plan. *   Therefore, all three accused are guilty of murder under Section 302 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code. *   The appellants are ordered to surrender and serve their sentences."

They also relied on the presumption of disproportionate assets under Section 5(3) of the Act, as the appellant was found to possess assets worth approximately Rs. 2,01,080, disproportionate to his known income. *   **Specific Instances Alleged:** The prosecution presented five specific instances of alleged gratification demands or acceptance.",

This presumption shifts the burden to the accused to satisfactorily explain the disproportionate assets. *   The court reviewed previous rulings (like *Biswabhusan Naik* and *C.S.D. Swamy*) to reinforce that the presumption under Section 5(3) is a strong evidentiary rule that can sustain a conviction for criminal misconduct, particularly under Section 5(1)(d). *   **Concurrent Findings:** The court generally defers to concurrent findings of fact but reviewed the evidence as requested. They found no vitiating circumstances to depart from the lower courts' conclusions, particularly regarding the disproportionate assets.",

        "arguments": "*   **Prosecution (State of Madhya Pradesh):** Argued that the \"Government of India Registered Firm No. 1468\" claim was a misrepresentation, misleading the public into believing the scheme had government backing.

The appellant was convicted only under Section 324 IPC for injuring Uttam Singh and sentenced to one year's rigorous imprisonment, being acquitted of other charges. Ramesh and Mulkraj were acquitted. *   The State appealed against the acquittal of the appellant and Mulkraj. Suresh appealed against his conviction. *   The High Court dismissed Suresh's appeal.

        "arguments": "*   The Supreme Court emphasized that an appellate court should not interfere with an acquittal unless the trial court's view is unsustainable. *   The Court analyzed the First Information Report (FIR) and found significant omissions regarding the appellant's alleged involvement in Harbinder Singh's murder. Specifically, the FIR did not mention the appellant stabbing Harbinder Singh, nor did it identify the appellant's daughters as eye-witnesses to the murder itself (only to wrapping a cloth on the wound). *   The dying declaration, allegedly made to Joginder Singh, also did not mention the appellant, and this dying declaration was not recorded in the FIR. *   The medical evidence regarding the stab wounds indicated that they were severe and likely to cause instantaneous death, making it questionable whether Harbinder Singh could have run into the lane or made a dying declaration as described by some witnesses. *   The court noted inconsistencies in the prosecution's evidence, particularly the lack of clarity on where the stabbing occurred and the reliability of the alleged eye-witnesses who were not mentioned as such in the FIR. *   Crucially, the High Court itself had previously found that there was no pre-concert between the accused and that they acted individually. This finding was inconsistent with the High Court's later conviction of the appellant under Section 302/34 IPC (common intention). *   If the appellant had already served the sentence for his conviction under Section 324 IPC, he was to be released forthwith.",

Treating each sample as a separate offense would lead to unjust consequences. *   The Prevention of Food Adulteration Act (PFA Act) prohibits manufacturing for sale, storing, selling, or distributing adulterated food. *   The sale of an adulterated article constitutes a distinct offense separate from storing it for sale. *   The definition of \"sale\" in the PFA Act includes sale for analysis. *   When samples are taken from different receptacles (cans in this case) for analysis, each taking of a sample constitutes a distinct and independent sale, and thus a separate offense if the sample is found adulterated.

Another person, also named Kaliaperumal (P.W. 1), was injured during the same incident. *   **Background:** There was existing enmity between the deceased and his maternal uncle (P.W. 7) on one side, and Accused No. 1 (A1), the village Karnam, on the other. A dispute involving cattle straying into A1's field and subsequent scolding escalated tensions. *   **Assault:** The deceased was bathing at the tank when A1 arrived with five other accused (A2-A6). A2 was armed with a \"cross stop,\" A3 and A4 with \"Aruvalls\" (a type of weapon), A5 with a stick, and A6 with a stick with a spear. A1 allegedly ordered the others to attack the deceased. A3 and A4 assaulted the deceased with Aruvalls, inflicting fatal head injuries. When P.W. 1 tried to intervene, A2 assaulted him with the cross stop, causing him to fall unconscious. A6 allegedly obstructed P.W. 1 from escaping. *   **Outcome:** The deceased died later that evening. P.W. 1 sustained multiple injuries.",

The evidence of P.W. 1 was considered, but the court found significant embellishment in his testimony regarding A1's alleged order. The plea of alibi for A1 was not adequately disproven by the prosecution, and the reasons for his acquittal by the Trial Court were deemed reasonably possible. Similarly, the Trial Court's acquittal of A5 and A6 was considered sound. *   **Rioting Charges:** The Court noted that the State did not appeal the acquittal of A2, A3, and A4 for rioting. Given that only three accused remained in the party of assailants after A1, A5, and A6 were acquitted, the formation of an unlawful assembly under section 147/148 IPC was not substantiated. Therefore, convictions for rioting were not maintainable. *   **A2's Liability for Murder:** The Court analyzed section 34 IPC and concluded that A2's act of assaulting P.W. 1 to prevent him from intervening in the fatal assault on the deceased constituted participation in the common criminal intention to commit murder. A2's presence and actions facilitated the murder by A3 and A4. *   **A3 & A4's Liability for Murder:** The Court found their convictions for murder, having mercilessly assaulted the deceased with Aruvalls on vital parts of the body, to be well-justified.",

        "arguments": "*   **Prosecution:** Argued that Ghanshyamsinh and Panch Mahendra testified to the demand and acceptance of the bribe by the appellant. Inspector Desai confirmed the recovery of tainted notes. The presence of anthracene powder on the appellant's hands, coupled with the recovery of money from his drawer, proved acceptance. The appellant was in charge of the police station on the day of the incident and thus in a position to influence the investigation. *   **Defence:** Contended that no formal complaint existed regarding the alleged abduction. The acquittal of Accused No. 1 meant the bribe couldn't be linked to any demand. Argued Ghanshyamsinh had a grudge. The defence presented a version where Mahendra (PW 4) handed the money to the appellant, claiming it was for the Sub Inspector. The defence argued the presumption under the Prevention of Corruption Act was rebutted by these circumstances. A technical defect in the charge was also raised. *   The defence version of Mahendra handing over the money was disproven by the absence of anthracene powder on Mahendra's hands. *   The appellant's admission of accepting the money and the presence of powder on his hands was crucial. *   The appellant was in charge of the station when the money was handed over. *   The presumption under Section 4(1) of the Prevention of Corruption Act was not rebutted by the defence. The mere absence of a registered case or a complaint did not negate the offence if the public servant extracted gratification by inducing a belief of rendering assistance. *   The acquittal of Accused No. 1 did not invalidate the evidence against the appellant regarding the bribe demand and acceptance. *   The technical defect in the charge was cured by Section 537 of the Criminal Procedure Code as no prejudice was caused to the appellant.",

This view focuses on the *purpose* of the empowerment. *   The Court preferred the \"broad view,\" aligning with the object and purpose of the Act, which is to suppress a specific type of mischief. *   The Act creates new offences and requires a special machinery for enforcement, justifying a broad interpretation of the empowerment clause to ensure efficacy. *   The \"narrow view\" was considered to introduce unnecessary inconvenience and reduce the Act's effectiveness. *   Precedents, particularly *State of Mysore vs Kashambi* and *Abdul Husein Tayabali vs State of Gujarat*, were heavily relied upon.

        "arguments": "*   **Prosecution's Circumstantial Evidence:** *   **Motive:** Strained marital relations, the victim's \"loose character\" and visits to the appellant's office causing him distress, and the appellant's marriage to a third wife suggested a motive for murder. A letter from the appellant in 1945 expressing his desire for the victim to be married far away due to her character and its potential impact on his service was highlighted. *   **Last Seen:** The appellant was allegedly seen traveling with the deceased on a train from Patna to Gaya on the night of September 3rd, a few hours before the estimated time of murder. *   **Meeting at Office:** The appellant met the deceased at his office in Patna on September 3rd. He arranged for her to stay there for the day and took her away by rickshaw in the evening.

Medical opinion suggested these could have been sustained during an assault with a sharp weapon like a penknife. *   **False Explanations:** The appellant provided explanations for meeting the deceased on the wrong date and for his injuries, which the courts found to be false. These false explanations were considered additional links in the chain of evidence. *   The circumstantial evidence did not fully establish the crucial links. *   There was a gap in the evidence regarding what happened after the appellant and the deceased were seen on the train towards Gaya. *   The nature of the injuries on the deceased and the lack of blood on her clothing suggested the murder might have been committed by more than one person. *   The knife found might not be the appellant's. *   The letter from 1945 was too old to be indicative of his state of mind at the time of the murder.",

It determined that the presence of artificial dye in linseed oil, which is prohibited by rules, clearly falls under clause (j), meaning the proviso to Section 16(1) is not attracted, and the minimum sentence must be imposed. *   **Probation:** The appellants pleaded for probation. The court stated that while probation is generally applicable, adulteration of food is a serious menace to public health and an economic offense. The court emphasized that the legislature's intent, evidenced by the minimum sentence and a later amendment excluding probation for offenses under the Act (except for those under 18), discourages granting probation for such offenses.",

        "arguments": "*   **Proviso to Section 16(1):** The Court analyzed Section 16(1) and its proviso. It held that the proviso only applies if the adulteration falls *exclusively* under sub-clause (1) of Section 2(i) or if it's misbranded under sub-clause (k) of Section 2(ix). The Court found that the offence involved misbranding under Section 2(ix)(c) (selling buffalo's milk by the name of cow's milk), which is a different species of misbranding, thus disentitling the accused from the benefit of the proviso. *   **Misbranding:** The Court determined that \"cow's milk\" and \"buffalo's milk\" are distinct articles of food. Selling buffalo's milk as cow's milk constitutes misbranding under Section 2(ix)(c) of the Act. *   **Vicarious Liability:** The Court found that while both partners were in charge of the business (Section 17(1)), the second accused (absent partner) could be acquitted. This was because the misrepresentation (calling it cow's milk) was made spontaneously by the third accused at the spot. There was no evidence of prior knowledge or a pattern of such practice to attribute \"scienter\" (knowledge) to the absent partner.

The timing of Bal Kishore lodging the FIR with an individual connected to the election also raised suspicion. *   **Reloading and Misfire:** The story of Subhash reloading a double-barreled gun after two shots and the reloaded cartridge misfiring, found in the deceased's dhoti, was deemed illogical and improbable. *   **Surrender Corroboration Weak:** The High Court overemphasized Subhash's surrender as corroboration. However, he surrendered with others in relation to a separate complaint, not specifically for this murder. Shyam Narain's arrest was for crossing railway lines, not a planned escape. *   **Lack of Corroboration:** Key witnesses mentioned in the FIR were not examined.",

        "arguments": "*   **Bar of Prior Proceedings:** The respondent argued that a previous fine under Section 488 (for breach of Rule 62) should preclude a demolition order under Section 363, citing a proviso that bars proceedings under Section 363 if proceedings under Section 493 are instituted. The Court rejected this, stating that Section 488 and Section 493 are distinct due to different penalties, and the Legislature did not expressly create a bar for Section 488. The Court also found Section 536 inapplicable for ordering demolition in the initial Section 488 proceedings, as the charge was solely for commencing construction without permission, not for violating specific building rules that would necessitate demolition. *   **Discretion and Relevance of Inconvenience:** The Court agreed that Section 363 grants the Magistrate discretion to order demolition and that the word \"may\" does not mean \"shall.\" They also agreed that the inconvenience to neighbours is not the sole deciding factor but rather whether the breaches adversely affect public interests. *   **Delay:** The claim of significant delay by the appellant was incorrect; the demolition proceedings were initiated promptly. *   **No Complaint:** While a lack of public complaint isn't irrelevant, it shouldn't be the primary basis for refusing demolition, especially when public interest is at stake. *   The Court held that the Corporation was **not barred** from taking proceedings under Section 363 despite prior proceedings under Section 488. *   The Court confirmed that Section 363 confers **discretion** upon the Magistrate regarding demolition orders. *   The Court found that the respondent's actions warranted severe action, but the passage of time made demolition inappropriate.",

It's not about whether the act was *actually* in duty, but whether the accused could *reasonably claim* to have done it in the performance of duty. *   **Scope of Official Duty:** The protection of Section 197 extends to acts done in the course of performing official duty, even if they exceed what is strictly necessary or involve an excess of power. The court acknowledged that it's not the duty *to commit an offence*, but the act itself must be examined in relation to official duty. *   **Search and Resistance:** Authorized officials have the right to use reasonable force to remove obstruction or overcome resistance during a lawful search. To hold otherwise would frustrate the purpose of the search. *   **Premises Error:** A bona fide mistake in the premises listed in the warrant or an honest error by the officials does not negate the possibility of the act being related to their official duty. *   **Constitutional Challenge:** The court declined to consider the constitutional challenge to Section 5(1) of the Act as it was not raised earlier. Section 197 CrPC was deemed not ultra vires, as the classification of public servants requiring protection is rational. *   **The Nature of the Acts:** The injuries sustained by the complainants were seen as consistent with a \"scuffle\" likely to occur during protests against a search, suggesting the acts were related to the performance of official duty.",

The police obtained specimen handwriting from the appellant and compared it to the forged receipt, with an expert opining they were by the same person. A test identification parade was conducted, where one witness identified the appellant with hesitation.",
        "issues": "*   Whether the evidence presented was sufficient to convict the appellant of offenses under Sections 468, 411, and 420 read with Section 109 of the Indian Penal Code. *   Specifically, whether the handwriting expert's opinion and the alleged presence of the appellant at the scene were sufficient corroboration for a conviction.",
        "arguments": "*   **Handwriting Expert's Opinion:** The Court acknowledged the handwriting expert's opinion that the forged receipt and the appellant's specimen handwriting matched. However, it emphasized that expert opinion, particularly on handwriting, should be treated with extreme caution and is inherently weak, requiring substantial corroboration. The court cited numerous precedents stating it is unsafe to base a conviction solely on such evidence. *   **Appellant's Presence:** The prosecution claimed the appellant was present with Umedi Lal when the iron sheets were being discussed for sale. The Court found this evidence unsatisfactory for several reasons: *   The appellant was a railway guard from Agra, and there was no evidence connecting him to the misdirection of the train or the theft of the blank receipt from Banmore Station (which was not within his jurisdiction). *   His presence with Umedi Lal was not definitively proven and was questioned. *   The appellant was on leave for a longer period than necessary if he were solely involved in the Ludhiana transaction on August 6, 1964. *   **Identification Parade:** The Court found the identification parade unreliable. One witness failed to identify the appellant. The other witness identified him only after hesitation, and it was questioned how he could remember the appellant from a single, brief encounter two and a half years prior. The appellant had also raised concerns about being shown to witnesses by the police before the parade. *   **Police Inaction:** The Court criticized the police for failing to trace key individuals like Umedi Lal and Bhoja Ram, and for not pursuing the trail of the stolen iron sheets. *   **Suspicion on M/s Jindal Khemka & Co.:** The Court noted that M/s Jindal Khemka & Co. and its partners might not have been entirely innocent, suggesting they might have taken the iron sheets themselves based on the forged receipt.",
        "decision": "The Supreme Court **allowed the appeal**, **set aside the order of conviction and sentence** against the appellant, and **acquitted him** of all charges.

The Court emphasized that the specific words used, not a summary, are what can be charged as a contravention. *   **Judicial Notice:** The Court acknowledged that courts can take judicial notice of notorious facts, such as the imminence of a railway strike on the given date and its subsequent launch.

No evidence was led to establish this link. *   **Alternative Provision:** The Court suggested that incitement to strike might be more appropriately covered under Rule 36(6)(j) read with Rule 43(1)(a) of the Defence of India Rules, dealing with \"prejudicial acts\" and instigation for cessation of work.

Since Section 357 expressly deals with compensation orders, the application should have been made under that section.

Therefore, the propriety and excessiveness of the fine are paramount.",

They contended this delegation extended to Zonal Chief Engineers who were created later. *   **Respondent (Tandon):** Argued that the delegation of power in 1956 was specifically to the Chief Engineers of the *three existing Commands* at that time. Zonal Chief Engineers were created later in 1962 and were subordinate to the Command Chief Engineers, thus not falling under the original delegation. They also argued that the subsequent letter in 1963, which mentioned Zonal Chief Engineers having powers, was not from the Engineer-in-Chief himself and did not constitute a proper delegation. *   The relevant law (Prevention of Corruption Act, Section 6(2)) states that the competent authority for sanction is the one who could remove the public servant from office at the time of the offense. *   The power to appoint generally includes the power to remove. *   The key was determining who had the power to appoint/remove Class III employees like Tandon. *   Analysis of the 1952 and 1965 Rules showed that appointment and penalty imposition powers were governed by specific authorities and delegations. *   The 1956 letter delegating powers was addressed to Chief Engineers of Commands. At that time, Zonal Chief Engineers did not exist. *   While reorganization in 1962 created Zonal Chief Engineers, they operated under the command and technical control of the Command Chief Engineers, indicating they were a \"class apart\" and not automatically included in the prior delegation to \"Chief Engineers of Commands.\" *   The 1963 letter, relied upon by the appellant, was not properly signed by the Engineer-in-Chief and its interpretation of the 1956 letter was deemed incorrect. *   No other valid order delegating the power of appointment to Class III posts to Zonal Chief Engineers prior to June 24, 1971, was presented.",

        "arguments": "*   Conviction for murder under Section 302 IPC without a specific charge for that offense is illegal. *   When the charge under Section 34 IPC fails due to the acquittal of the co-accused, the conviction under Section 302 IPC should also fail. *   A charge must clearly inform the accused of the offense they need to meet. *   Illegality in the mode of trial, especially concerning charges, is not cured by Sections 535 and 537 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Cr.P.C.). *   The offense committed was not murder, but likely grievous hurt or culpable homicide not amounting to murder. *   The distinction between \"illegality\" and \"irregularity\" is crucial. *   The Code of Criminal Procedure is designed to further justice, not frustrate it with technicalities. *   Omission to frame a separate charge is a curable irregularity if no prejudice is caused to the accused. *   The accused was aware he was being tried for murder through the trend of cross-examination and his examination under Section 342 Cr.P.C. *   Section 34 IPC does not create a distinct offense, so a charge under Section 302 read with Section 34 means the accused is charged for his act in the murder itself. *   The medical evidence and facts indicate the offense was murder. *   The Code of Criminal Procedure aims for substantial justice, not strict adherence to technicalities. *   Sections 225, 535, and 537 Cr.P.C. indicate that errors, omissions, or irregularities in charges (including absence of a charge) do not vitiate a trial unless they have *in fact* occasioned a failure of justice (prejudice to the accused). *   The term \"illegality\" is not defined in the Code; the focus should be on whether prejudice occurred. *   While a charge is important, the substance of the information conveyed to the accused is paramount. *   In this specific case, the appellant was sufficiently informed that he was being tried for murder through the evidence, cross-examination, and his own statement. He was not prejudiced by the absence of a separate charge under Section 302 IPC. *   On the merits, the injury was likely to cause death, but not sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, and there was no evidence of the appellant knowing it would cause death. Therefore, the offense was not murder but culpable homicide not amounting to murder under the second part of Section 304 IPC. *   A total absence of a charge where one is required by law (like in Sessions trials) is a contravention of mandatory provisions and renders the conviction invalid, irrespective of prejudice. *   Sections 535 and 537 Cr.P.C. cannot override the fundamental requirement of a charge in such cases. *   The framing of a charge and the recording of a plea are fundamental procedural steps.",
        "decision": "1.  **Appeals dismissed.** 2.  The conviction for murder under Section 302 IPC was upheld as *not* illegal. The Court found that while the charge was framed under Section 302 read with Section 34 IPC, the appellant was not prejudiced by the absence of a separate charge for Section 302 IPC simpliciter, as he was clearly aware throughout the proceedings that he was being tried for murder. 3.  The conviction for murder was reduced to **culpable homicide not amounting to murder** under the **second part of Section 304 of the Indian Penal Code**. 4.

        "case_facts": "*   **Civil Appeal No. 1134 of 1973:** A case was filed against an ex-Major (R.C. Bhattacharjee) and a businessman (Manmal Bhutoria, the respondent). The allegation was that Bhattacharjee, in conspiracy with Bhutoria, accepted tenders for military supplies at inflated prices, causing loss to the government. This was framed as an offense under Section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947.",
        "issues": "*   **Co-accused's Status:** Ex-Major Bhattacharjee had ceased to be a public servant before the case was allotted to the Special Court. *   **High Court Proceedings:** The respondent (Bhutoria) filed a writ petition in the Calcutta High Court, arguing that the Special Court lacked jurisdiction because Bhattacharjee was no longer a public servant when the case was allotted, and that the Act and allotment were discriminatory. *   Does a Special Court constituted under the West Bengal Criminal Law Amendment (Special Courts) Act, 1949, have jurisdiction to try an offence under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947, if a co-accused public servant had ceased to be a public servant before the case was allotted to the Special Court? *   Does the exclusion of a public servant who has ceased to be in office from certain provisions (like sanction for prosecution under Section 6 of the Prevention of Corruption Act) and their inclusion in others (trial by Special Court) violate Article 14 of the Constitution (equality before the law)? *   Can an \"outsider\" (a private citizen) be tried alongside a public servant for offences under the Prevention of Corruption Act and the Bengal Act, particularly concerning conspiracy or abetment?",
        "arguments": "*   The Bengal Act and the Prevention of Corruption Act only apply to public servants, and since Bhattacharjee was no longer a public servant, the Special Court had no jurisdiction. *   Treating a former public servant differently from a current public servant regarding trial and prosecution procedures constitutes discrimination violating Article 14. *   As an outsider, Bhutoria should not be tried by the Special Court, as the Act and its scheduled offenses primarily concern public servants. *   **Status of Former Public Servants:** Previous Supreme Court rulings establish that while sanction for prosecution under Section 6 of the Prevention of Corruption Act might not be required if a public servant has ceased to be in office *at the time of taking cognizance*, the offense committed while in service remains valid. Former public servants and current public servants are not similarly situated and thus not subject to the same treatment under Article 14. *   **Jurisdiction:** The date of commission of the offense is when the person must be a public servant. However, the date of taking cognizance is when the court determines jurisdiction. If a person has ceased to be a public servant by the time of cognizance, Section 6 of the Act regarding sanction is not applicable. This does not divest the Special Court of jurisdiction, especially when the case was properly allotted under the Bengal Act. *   **Outsiders:** The Bengal Act (specifically Item 8 of its Schedule) and the Prevention of Corruption Act (Section 165A IPC regarding abetment) clearly allow for the trial of outsiders who conspire with or abet public servants in committing scheduled offenses. *   **Article 14:** The distinction between public servants in office and those who have ceased to be in office is a valid classification, not discriminatory under Article 14. The High Court's interpretation of discrimination was misconceived. *   **Bengal Act Provisions:** The proviso to Section 4(1) of the Bengal Act, allowing trial of other offenses, and Section 10, incorporating the Prevention of Corruption Act, do not invalidate the Special Court's jurisdiction.",
        "decision": "*   **Criminal Appeal No. 358 of 1976:** The appeal **failed and was dismissed** for similar reasons as Civil Appeal No. 1134 of 1973, affirming the Special Judge's jurisdiction to try cases involving former public servants. *   **Criminal Appeal No. 319 of 1974:** This appeal was **dismissed as abated** due to the death of the sole appellant. *   **Overall:** The Supreme Court clarified that a public servant ceasing to be in office does not oust the jurisdiction of the Special Court to try offenses committed while they were in service. Such a distinction does not violate Article 14 of the Constitution. Outsiders can also be tried for abetment or conspiracy related to such offenses."

        "arguments": "*   The High Court committed a serious error by failing to provide a reasonable opportunity for the appellants to rebut the evidence of the witnesses it summoned under Section 540 Cr.P.C. *   The High Court's examination of the Sessions Judge as a witness was an extraordinary and erroneous course of action. *   If empty cartridges were found, it would significantly alter the case's complexion, suggesting the deceased might have fired shots himself. *   **Procedural Error:** The Supreme Court agreed that the High Court committed a serious legal error by refusing the appellants an opportunity to rebut the evidence of the witnesses examined under Section 540 Cr.P.C. This violates principles of natural justice and the right to a fair hearing (Audi Alteram Partem). *   **Examining the Judge:** The Supreme Court strongly disapproved of a judge being called as a witness in a case they decided, citing established legal principles against such practices to maintain judicial confidence. *   **Evidence of Cartridges:** The Court meticulously examined the evidence, including the Investigating Officer's testimony, the inquest report (Ka 10), and seizure memos (Ka 13 & Ka 14). They concluded, based on the inquest report and the description of the recovered items, that the four cartridges found at the spot were indeed *live*, not empty. The Investigating Officer's conflicting statement was attributed to confusion or recording error, contradicted by his own earlier report and the physical description of the cartridges. *   **Documentary Evidence:** The Court found the inquest report (Ka 10) and site plan (Ka 18) to be admissible and crucial. They distinguished these from statements made during police investigation (Section 162 Cr.P.C.) because they recorded the Investigating Officer's direct observations at the scene. *   **Witness Credibility:** The Court found the testimony of the eye-witnesses (P.Ws. 1, 2, and 3) to be reliable, consistent, and corroborated by the FIR and the injury to P.W. 3. *   **Delay:** Despite the procedural error, the Court decided not to remit the case back to the High Court due to the significant delay, as the incident occurred over 8 years prior. *   **The appeals were dismissed**, and the convictions and sentences upheld by the High Court were affirmed.",
        "decision": "*   **Appellants:** Seven appellants in one appeal (Rameshwar Dayal, Acchmal, Janmeje, Rohan, Raghunandan, Ramdas, Sudama) and two in another (Rohtas, Sukhdev). *   **Convictions:** All appellants were convicted under Section 302/149 IPC (murder) and sentenced to life imprisonment. They received additional convictions and sentences for offenses under Sections 324, 394, 148, and 147 IPC. *   **Background:** The incident stemmed from a long-standing enmity between two parties. The immediate provocation was ongoing proceedings under Section 107/117 Cr.P.C. initiated by the deceased (Babu Ram) and Munnalal against each other. *   **The Incident:** On December 9, 1969, Babu Ram was going to court for the Section 107/117 Cr.P.C. proceedings. He was ambushed by the appellants. Some appellants were armed with guns and a pistol, others with spears, Kantas, and lathes. Shots were fired at Babu Ram, causing his death. One of the appellants also injured another person, Chhoteylal, who tried to intervene. During the incident, the appellants snatched Babu Ram's revolver and cartridges, as well as documents related to the court proceedings. *   **FIR:** The First Information Report (FIR) was lodged promptly by the deceased's son, Rajendra (P.W. 1), detailing the incident. *   **Trial & Appeal:** The Sessions Judge convicted the appellants. The High Court, on appeal, upheld these convictions and sentences. *   The High Court's refusal to grant the appellants an opportunity to rebut the evidence of these court witnesses. *   The crucial factual dispute regarding whether four cartridges found at the scene were \"live\" or \"empty.\" *   The admissibility and weight of documentary evidence like the inquest report and site plan. *   The Supreme Court held that the High Court committed a serious error of law by failing to give the appellants an opportunity to rebut the evidence of witnesses summoned under Section 540 Cr.P.C. *   However, considering the age of the case and the potential for further delay, the Supreme Court decided to examine the evidence itself, *excluding* the evidence of the witnesses examined by the High Court under Section 540 Cr.P.C. *   Upon re-examining the evidence, the Supreme Court found that the prosecution had proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt."

It emphasized that bail is primarily about ensuring appearance in court, not necessarily about financial surety. *   **\"Own Bond\" Interpretation:** The court analyzed various sections of the Code of Criminal Procedure and concluded that the term \"bail\" should be interpreted broadly to include release on one's own bond, with or without sureties.

Government records and witness statements confirmed this. *   **Rapid Acquisition:** While the speed of acquisition was noted as suspicious, it was explained by the urgency of the All India Radio's need for land and the potential anxiety of subordinate officers to oblige a high-ranking official. The acquisition process followed a sanctioned estimate from the government. *   **Compensation Amount:** The Court found that the compensation awarded was for the *lessee's interest* (Respondent No. 1's interest), not the proprietary interest (which belonged to the government). This was consistent with government records and the nature of the acquisition. The valuation was deemed reasonable for the lessee's interest. *   **Conspiracy:** The Court found no legal evidence to demonstrate a \"meeting of minds\" or conspiracy between the two respondents. *   **Concurrent Findings:** The Supreme Court expressed reluctance to interfere with concurrent findings of the High Court and the Special Judge, especially in the absence of special circumstances. *   The Court held that both the Special Judge and the High Court were legally justified in discharging the respondents because there was **no sufficient ground for proceeding against them**.

        "arguments": "*   The Magistrate lacked jurisdiction to take cognizance of the conspiracy offence without the State Government's sanction under Section 196A(2) CrPC, as Section 466 IPC is a non-cognizable offence. *   The offence did not meet the requirements of Section 195(1)(c) CrPC because Section 466 IPC is not explicitly listed, and the alleged tampering did not involve a document produced or given in evidence *during* the proceedings before the court.",
        "decision": "*   **Application of Section 195(1)(c) Conditions:** The Court found that the alleged tampering occurred during the preparation of the paper book for the Supreme Court appeal. Crucially, the document in question (Dr. Barat's deposition) was *not* produced or given in evidence in the High Court proceedings. The tampering happened after the appeal hearing had concluded.

This meant that the requirement for the State Government's written consent to initiate proceedings for criminal conspiracy (Section 120B IPC) under Section 196A(2) was essential. *   **Lack of Sanction:** As no such consent was obtained from the State Government, the Magistrate lacked the jurisdiction to take cognizance of the offence. *   The Supreme Court allowed the appeal. *   The order of committal passed by the Magistrate was quashed.

        "arguments": "*   The significant delay in executing the detention order renders it ineffective and transforms it into a punitive measure. *   The first ground is flawed because the detaining authority was not informed that key witnesses had retracted their statements, which is a vital fact. *   The second ground is invalid as it relies solely on an intelligence report, and the lack of disclosure of the report's author and basis violates the detenu's right to an effective representation. *   If any single ground is bad, the entire detention order must be struck down, especially as Section 5A of COFEPOSA was not in effect when the order was made. *   The delay in execution is attributable to the appellant's own conduct in evading arrest, and he should not benefit from his own wrongdoing. *   Regarding the first ground, the fact that individuals recanted was mentioned in the adjudication order that was before the detaining authority. *   Regarding the second ground, the detention was not based solely on the intelligence report, and if the detenu needed more particulars, he could have requested them. *   The court acknowledged that delay can vitiate a detention order, but only if it's unexplained.

        "arguments": "**Kailasam, J. (Dissenting Opinion):** *   Argued that when a Magistrate agrees with a police report under Section 169 and discharges the accused, or when bail/remand proceedings occur, the Magistrate is acting in a judicial capacity. *   These actions, even if during investigation, constitute \"proceedings in or in relation to any court\" as interpreted by some High Courts. *   Therefore, Section 195(1)(b) should be attracted, requiring a complaint from the Magistrate. **Koshal, J.

The Magistrate was acting in a supervisory capacity during the investigation phase, before formal cognizance was taken. Therefore, a complaint by the Magistrate was not necessary to prosecute Trivedi for offences under Section 211 IPC.",

The investigation stage is distinct from the court trial stage. *   **Cognizance is Key:** The stage of \"taking cognizance\" under Section 190 is crucial. Before cognizance, proceedings are part of the investigation, not formal court proceedings attracting Section 195(1)(b). *   **Bail/Remand Proceedings:** While bail proceedings involve judicial action, the specific definition of \"Court\" in Section 195(2) and the general principles from cases like *Shell Co. of Australia* and *Shri Virinder Kumar Satyawadi* require more than just judicial action; they require a formal judicial proceeding with defined rights to be heard and present evidence. Bail/remand proceedings during investigation, where the complainant has limited or no role, do not meet this threshold. *   **Distinguishing Precedent:** Differentiated from cases like *J.D. Boywalla* where the Magistrate had passed orders after considering the police report and the matter was more advanced than a mere investigation stage. *   **Focus on Formal Proceedings:** Concluded that discharge on a police report under Section 169 and bail/remand proceedings during investigation do not constitute \"proceedings in or in relation to any court\" in the sense required by Section 195(1)(b) because cognizance had not been taken by the Magistrate. The appeal was allowed.

Krishnaswamy (A2), were convicted for criminal conspiracy and corruption related to a land leveling and rock cutting project for the Indian Oil Corporation (IOC). *   **Project:** IOC decided to purchase land in Trombay, Bombay, for storage tanks. A revised survey indicated significant rock cutting and filling work was needed. *   **Tendering Process:** Tenders were invited. Initially, Ram & Co. submitted the lowest tender, followed by N.N. Desai (A4). *   **Revised Survey:** A subsequent survey led to revised quantities of work, with A4's revised tender becoming the lowest. *   **Contract Award:** Despite some reservations and suggestions for re-tendering, the contract was eventually awarded to A4. *   **Allegations:** The prosecution alleged that A1 and A2, along with others (including A3 and A4), manipulated the survey, inflated quantities, fabricated documents, and irregularly awarded the contract to A4, causing a financial loss to the IOC. *   **Key Documents:** Original and fabricated level plans and worksheets, tender notices, comparative statements, work orders, and measurement certificates were central to the case. *   **Conviction:** Both A1 and A2 were convicted by the Special Judge and their convictions were upheld by the Bombay High Court.",

        "arguments": "*   **Prosecution's Stand:** The prosecution argued that A1 and A2, as senior officials, orchestrated a scheme to award the contract to A4. This involved manipulating survey data, fabricating documents (level plans, worksheets), inflating work quantities in the work order, and pushing through the award despite concerns raised by other officials. They argued A1 and A2 abused their positions and acted dishonestly. *   **Defence's Stand (Appellants):** The defence contended that: *   The tendering process was largely followed, and A4's tender was legitimately the lowest after revisions. *   The alleged manipulations and fabrications were not conclusively proven to be the work of A1 and A2, or that they acted with dishonest intent. *   Key witnesses were not examined, leaving gaps in the prosecution's case. *   A1 had a distinguished service record with commendations for integrity. *   A2's actions, while potentially negligent, did not demonstrate criminal intent, as he relied on subordinate engineers. *   The evidence was largely circumstantial and did not exclude all reasonable hypotheses of innocence. *   The Supreme Court meticulously examined each piece of circumstantial evidence presented by the High Court. *   It found that many of the High Court's findings were not supported by concrete evidence or were based on conjecture. *   The court highlighted inconsistencies in the statements of A3 regarding document fabrication and timing. *   It noted that crucial witnesses like K.S. Joshi were not produced, creating a \"lacuna.\" *   The court found that A1's actions, particularly initialing the final bill, were routine and lacked proof of dishonest intent, especially considering his service record and the absence of clear evidence that he was aware of the extent of inflation. *   A2's negligence was acknowledged, but the court found insufficient evidence to prove criminal intent or direct involvement in fabricating the work order. The endorsement on the work order copy was seen as weakening the prosecution's case against him. *   The court emphasized the principle that circumstantial evidence must be of a conclusive nature, excluding every hypothesis but guilt.",

Malik, was granted custody of the pillars to study them. He returned fake pillars. *   A new case was registered against N.N. Malik and H.L. Mehra for criminal conspiracy, cheating, and misappropriation related to the fake pillars. *   The Narang brothers (appellants) later emerged as suspects, believed to have commissioned the fakes and exported the genuine pillars to London. *   A separate FIR was registered against the Narang brothers. *   N.N. Malik was granted pardon and his confession was recorded, implicating the Narang brothers. *   A charge sheet was filed in Delhi against the Narang brothers and others. Extradition proceedings were initiated for two brothers in London. *   The Narang brothers were extradited to India. *   The case initially filed in Ambala against Malik and Mehra was withdrawn to facilitate prosecution in Delhi. *   The Delhi High Court dismissed petitions to quash the proceedings against the Narang brothers.",

        "arguments": "*   **Distinguishing the Conspiracies:** The Court compared the FIRs and charge sheets and found significant differences. The Ambala case focused on the conspiracy between Malik and Mehra to cheat and substitute fake pillars. The Delhi case alleged a larger conspiracy involving the Narang brothers to obtain the pillars and then export and sell them. The conspirators, their objects, and the alleged offences differed substantially. The Ambala conspiracy was found to be part of the larger Delhi conspiracy. *   **Police Power to Investigate:** The Court affirmed the police's statutory right and duty to investigate cognizable offenses. It was established that under the Criminal Procedure Code, 1898 (and later codified in 1973), the police's right to investigate is not exhausted by filing an initial charge sheet or by the court taking cognizance. Fresh investigations are permissible when new facts emerge. *   **Jurisdiction and Withdrawal:** The Court held that the police acted within their rights to investigate the new information that surfaced, leading to the Delhi case. The withdrawal of the Ambala case was not seen as an abuse of process but a pragmatic step given the broader conspiracy discovered and the need to prosecute all involved parties. The fact that the earlier case was withdrawn did not retroactively invalidate the Delhi court's jurisdiction, especially since the Delhi investigation uncovered a distinct, larger conspiracy. *   **Practical Necessity:** The Court emphasized the practical necessity of allowing further investigations to ensure justice for both the prosecution and the defense, citing various High Court and Supreme Court precedents. While formal permission from the court for further investigation is desirable, its absence did not necessarily render the investigation illegal.",
        "decision": "*   The conspiracy investigated in the Delhi case was **not identical** to the one in the Ambala case; it was a broader conspiracy. *   The police had the **statutory right to investigate** fresh facts and register a new FIR even after an earlier charge sheet had been filed and cognizance taken by a Magistrate. *   The **withdrawal of the Ambala case was permissible** and did not amount to an abuse of process, especially given the discovery of the larger conspiracy. *   The **Delhi court had jurisdiction** to take cognizance of the case based on the new investigation and charge sheet."

This expectation could arise from the gaming itself. *   The Supreme Court agreed with the High Court's interpretation of Clause (ii). *   It also invoked Section 7 of the Bombay Act, which creates a presumption of a \"common gaming house\" once instruments of gaming are seized.

He and four agricultural sub-overseers were tried for criminal conspiracy (Section 120B IPC), criminal breach of trust (Section 409 IPC), and falsification of accounts (Section 477A IPC). The prosecution alleged that the appellant conspired with his subordinates to misappropriate government funds allocated for the \"Grow More Food Scheme,\" specifically for subsidizing oil cake for agriculturists. They purportedly achieved this by showing false purchases and distributions, and falsifying accounts, misappropriating Rs. 4,943.40.

The High Court upheld the conspiracy conviction (Section 120B) but acquitted the appellant of the substantive charges (Sections 409 and 477A) due to insufficient proof of entrustment and lack of specificity in the charges, respectively.

        "arguments": "The appellant argued: *   Convicting him alone for conspiracy while others were acquitted is legally unsustainable, citing precedents like *Topan Das vs. State of Bombay*. *   Acquittal on substantive charges (409, 477A) should lead to acquittal on the conspiracy charge for those offences. *   Evidence disbelieved against others should not be used against him for conspiracy. *   Section 342 Cr.P.C. compliance was deficient. The Court reasoned: *   **Acquittal of Co-accused:** The Court distinguished *Topan Das* by noting that in this case, the approver (Pitabas Sahu) and other prosecution witnesses were implicated, meaning the appellant was not convicted of conspiring with himself. The acquittal of others by the trial court was not necessarily based on disbelief of evidence but on giving benefit of doubt, and their case was not before this Court. *   **Acquittal on Substantive Charges:** The Court held that conspiracy is complete upon agreement, irrespective of whether the substantive offences were committed. The acquittal on Sections 409 and 477A was due to technical reasons (lack of entrustment proof, vague charges) rather than a finding that no misappropriation or falsification occurred. *   **Evidence Disbelieved:** The trial court's acquittal of co-accused was not based on wholesale disbelief of prosecution evidence but on giving the benefit of doubt. The approver's evidence, corroborated by others, was found credible by the High Court. *   **Section 342 Cr.P.C.:** The examination was sufficient. The general question about \"evidence of the witnesses\" met the requirement, and the specific omission of the approver's name in the charge did not prejudice the appellant, as the approver was central to the prosecution case throughout. *   **Omission of Approver's Name in Charge:** While not ideal, the omission did not mislead the appellant or occasion a failure of justice, especially considering the approver's central role in the prosecution's case and corroborative evidence. Section 225 and 537 of the Cr.P.C. were applied. The Court also noted that the concept of \"repugnancy\" used in English law (where conviction of one conspirator with acquittal of others is invalid) doesn't strictly apply in India due to statutory provisions.",

It held that the appellant's conviction for criminal conspiracy under Section 120B IPC was sustainable despite the acquittal of his co-accused, given the involvement of the approver and other witnesses in the conspiracy. The acquittal on substantive charges did not invalidate the conspiracy conviction. The procedural objections regarding the charge and the examination under Section 342 Cr.P.C. were found to be without merit and did not occasion a failure of justice."

Section 7(i) holds liable anyone who sells adulterated food \"by any person on his behalf,\" which includes agents and servants.

This Act aimed to abolish intermediaries and vest their interests in the State, establishing a direct relationship between the State and tillers. *   A notification under the Abolition Act made the land vested in the State from June 1, 1959. *   A Board of Trustees managed the deity's affairs, and the Managing Trustee applied to have certain lands settled with the deity as occupancy tenants, claiming \"Khas possession.\" *   Patel contested this, claiming he had \"Khas possession.\" *   The Collector, under the Abolition Act, found Patel had \"Khas possession\" of one plot (Plot No. 5, 20.14 acres) but on behalf of the deity. He settled the land with Patel as an occupancy tenant for and on behalf of the deity. *   Later, the deity's Managing Trustee filed a complaint with the Assistant Commissioner of Endowments to recover possession from Patel, arguing the deity, not Patel, was the occupancy tenant. *   The Assistant Commissioner and then the Commissioner of Endowments ruled in favour of the deity. *   Patel challenged these Endowments department orders in the Orissa High Court, which upheld the deity's claim. This led to Civil Appeal No. 2036 of 1973. *   Separately, a criminal case (under Section 145 CrPC) arose when the deity, claiming to have recovered possession of Plot No. 5 (now designated as Plot No. 15, 22.58 acres), accused Patel of disturbing possession. *   Initially, proceedings were dropped due to no apprehended breach of peace, but later revived due to an emergency report.

His actions (coming to the venue, choosing a seat, asking the boy to move, attempting to escape, and later asking for forgiveness) indicated he knew what he was doing and could form intent. *   The Court held that Basdev failed to prove incapacity to form the intention to cause bodily injury sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, due to his intoxication. *   Therefore, the law presumes he intended the natural consequences of his act. *   The offense was not reduced from murder to culpable homicide not amounting to murder. *   The conviction and sentence of life imprisonment were upheld, and the appeal was dismissed."

Women who intervened were also injured. *   **Aftermath:** Injured parties were taken to the hospital. The deceased died en route. The appellants also sustained injuries. *   **Conflicting Reports:** Bhimrao (appellant No. 1) filed a report alleging he and his family were attacked by the deceased's party. The formal FIR was registered based on a statement taken from Bhimrao (PW 12) at the hospital. *   **Lower Courts:** The Sessions Judge convicted six appellants under Sections 302 read with 149 IPC (murder) and Section 148 IPC (rioting armed with deadly weapons).

They relied on eyewitness testimony and medical evidence. *   **Defence:** Contended that the deceased and their brothers attacked the appellants first, and the appellants acted in self-defense. They highlighted inconsistencies in the prosecution witnesses' statements and pointed to injuries on the appellants. *   **Court's Analysis:** *   The court acknowledged animosity between the parties. *   It analyzed the testimony of Bhimrao Kadam (PW 20), who intervened in the initial dispute and later witnessed the aftermath. The court found his testimony reliable and interpreted it to suggest the deceased were attacked after the initial dispute. *   Medical evidence was crucial.

        "arguments": "The Supreme Court analyzed the legislative intent behind Section 438, referencing the Law Commission's reports. They noted the departure from the wording of Sections 437 and 439, suggesting this was deliberate to grant broader discretion. The Court emphasized that Section 438 operates *before* arrest, unlike Sections 437/439, and is crucial for protecting liberty during the vulnerable pre-arrest stage. They found the High Court's imposed limitations to be too restrictive and not supported by the statute, potentially making the provision constitutionally vulnerable under Article 21.",
        "decision": "The Supreme Court held that: *   **Wide Discretion:** Section 438 grants broad discretion to the High Court and Court of Session to grant anticipatory bail. This discretion should not be curtailed by imposing rigid judicial restrictions not found in the statute. *   **No Implicit Limitations from Section 437:** The limitations found in Section 437 (regarding offenses punishable with death or life imprisonment) are *not* implicitly read into Section 438. The court can grant anticipatory bail even for offenses punishable with life imprisonment if the circumstances warrant, though it remains a factor for consideration. *   **No \"Special Case\" Requirement:** The requirement for the applicant to make out a \"special case\" (beyond having a reasonable belief of arrest) is not justified and unduly restricts the provision. *   **Investigative Powers Not Hampered:** An order of anticipatory bail does not prevent police investigation. Conditions can be imposed (as per Section 438(2)) to ensure cooperation and prevent obstruction or tampering with evidence/witnesses. The police may still seek custody if necessary for discovery under Section 27 of the Evidence Act, provided appropriate conditions are met. *   **No \"Blanket\" Orders:** While discretion is wide, \"blanket orders\" of anticipatory bail (covering any offense, anytime) should not generally be passed. The applicant must show a \"reason to believe\" based on reasonable grounds for arrest concerning specific potential offenses. *   **Conditions are Permissible:** The court can and should impose conditions under Section 438(2) to balance individual liberty with the needs of justice and investigation. *   **Timeliness:** An application under Section 438 is available even before an FIR is filed, but not after arrest. In essence, the Supreme Court restored the broad discretionary power intended by the legislature in Section 438, setting aside the restrictive approach adopted by the High Court and affirming that judicial discretion, when exercised judiciously, is the best safeguard against misuse."

The transfer of appeals to the Supreme Court was deemed more advantageous than an appeal to the High Court, which could be summarily dismissed. *   **Delegation of Power (Section 5):** The Court held that the discretion of the Central Government to make a declaration under Section 5(1) was not arbitrary, as it was guided by the preamble and required a prima facie case and adherence to specific guidelines. The Court presumed that such a high authority would act bona fide. *   **Parliamentary Competence:** The Court affirmed Parliament's legislative competence to create Special Courts. *   **Declaration Laying Before Parliament (Section 13):** The Court ruled that the provision for laying declarations before Parliament was directory, not mandatory, and non-compliance did not invalidate the declaration. *   **Constitutional Objections Overruled:** The Court upheld the constitutional validity of the Special Courts Act, 1979, ruling that its provisions, including the classification of offenders, the procedure, and the powers of the Central Government, did not violate Articles 14 or 21 of the Constitution. *   **Acquittal of Appellants:** The Court found that the prosecution failed to prove the case against the appellants (Vidya Charan Shukla and Sanjay Gandhi) beyond a reasonable doubt. *   There was no sufficient evidence of a conspiracy between them. *   The evidence connecting them to the alleged destruction of the film was insufficient, unreliable, or disproven by other evidence (especially alibis). *   **Appeals Allowed:** The convictions and sentences against Vidya Charan Shukla and Sanjay Gandhi were set aside, and they were acquitted of all charges. *   **State Appeal Dismissed:** Consequently, the State's appeal for enhancement of sentences was dismissed. *   **Bail Discharged:** The appellants, who were on bail, were discharged from their bail bonds."

        "arguments": "*   **Jurisdiction of Committing Magistrate:** The Court affirmed that the Committing Magistrate, under the 1973 Code, still performs a judicial function by ensuring an offense is prima facie disclosed before committing to the Sessions Court.

        "decision": "*   **\"Political Offences\":** While the Indian Penal Code doesn't categorize \"political offences,\" the Court recognized their existence in jurisprudence and international law.

While political considerations were present, the withdrawal of only four out of twenty-five cases, coupled with the complainant's subsequent agreement acknowledging the Trust's title and receiving compensation, provided a plausible rationale for amicable settlement, even if politically influenced. *   **General Caution:** The Court emphasized that criminal justice is not a political tool. Courts and Prosecutors must be vigilant against politicking, ensuring prosecutions are not converted into persecutions or withdrawals used as rewards for wrongdoers. The credibility of the rule of law depends on this vigilance. *   **Special Leave Petition (Criminal) No. 3115 of 1979:** Dismissed.

The company's activities, including the regular sale of oil, place it within this category.",
        "arguments": "*   The company is a vanaspati manufacturer, not an oil mill, as vanaspati is vegetable ghee, not oil. *   Any oil extraction is incidental to vanaspati production, and the company doesn't primarily sell oil. *   **Vanaspati is Oil:** Vanaspati is fundamentally hydrogenated vegetable oil. While processed, it retains its essential characteristics as a cooking medium and vegetable fat. The term \"oil\" in the Act's schedule should include such processed vegetable oils. *   **Sale of Oil:** The company regularly sells oil, refined oil, oil cakes, and de-oiled cakes, not just in exigencies. This regular sale of oil itself classifies part of its operation as an \"oil mill.\"",
        "decision": "The Supreme Court **dismissed both appeals**. *   The Court held that the company, Morvi Vegetable Products Ltd., is an **\"oil mill\"** within the meaning of the Minimum Wages Act because it manufactures vanaspati (which is a form of oil) and also regularly sells oil as part of its business. *   Consequently, the company is covered by the provisions of the Minimum Wages Act. *   The failure to maintain the mandatory documents constituted an offense under Section 22A of the Act. *   The convictions and sentences imposed on the appellants were upheld."

An agreement was made that Sumitra could continue her studies and work as a teacher. *   **Dispute:** The accused (Rama Nand and his family) persistently demanded Sumitra give up her teaching job and reside permanently with them. Sumitra refused. *   **Disappearance:** Sumitra visited Rama Nand's house on May 13, 1972, and disappeared from there on May 14, 1972. *   **Initial Police Report:** Shish Ram lodged a report claiming Sumitra went to the river to attend to nature's call, her salwar and shoes were found on the bank, suggesting suicide. *   **Investigation:** The police registered a case under Section 364 IPC.

The deceased, Pappoo, had actively opposed the appellant's advances and had even intervened legally when the appellant claimed to be married to Ranjana. *   **Previous Incidents:** The appellant was evicted from the deceased's family property where he was a tenant. He filed false claims of marriage and unlawful detention of Ranjana, both of which were dismissed by the Magistrate and High Court. The Principal of Ranjana's school complained about the appellant's indecent overtures. The appellant had also threatened Pappoo the evening before the murder. *   **Attendant Circumstances:** Pappoo used to escort his sister Ranjana to school due to concerns for her safety. On the day of the murder, after dropping Ranjana at school, Pappoo was shot and killed as he was returning home. *   **Eyewitnesses:** Harish Chandra (domestic servant of the family) and Ashok Kumar (friend of Harish Chandra) claimed to have witnessed the shooting. *   **Discovery of Weapon:** The appellant was arrested, and a pistol was recovered from rubbish near where he had fled.

The appellant also raised an alibi defense, claiming he was on duty at his workplace at the time of the murder. *   The court found the eyewitness testimony credible, despite some initial doubts about their presence at the scene. Ranjana Kishore's prompt and detailed First Information Report (FIR) corroborated the eyewitnesses' account and demonstrated the lack of opportunity for fabrication. *   The alibi defense was dismissed. The court found the distance between the appellant's workplace and the crime scene was short enough to allow him to be present at both locations. The court questioned the timing of his arrest from outside the factory. *   While acknowledging some weaknesses in the evidence of the weapon's recovery, the court found it contributed to the overall case. *   The concurrent findings of the Sessions Court and High Court, being reasonable, were given significant weight. *   The court acknowledged the gravity of the crime and the motive. *   However, two factors led them to reduce the sentence from death to life imprisonment: *   The appellant was provoked by Pappoo's insult the previous evening regarding his social status and poverty, suggesting a sense of social injustice that contributed to his mental state, even if not legally amounting to \"sudden\" provocation. *   The court suspected that the eyewitnesses had not revealed the entire truth, particularly regarding the circumstances of the shooting. The absence of drag marks on Pappoo's scooter and the state in which it was found suggested that Pappoo might have stopped and exchanged words with the appellant before being shot, implying a possible altercation. This uncertainty about the precise events made the death penalty unsafe.",

        "arguments": "*   The Court examined the historical context of maintenance laws (Section 488 of the 1898 Code vs. Section 125 of the 1973 Code). *   It highlighted that the 1973 Code's Explanation to Section 125(1)(b) significantly widened the definition of \"wife\" to include divorced women who have not remarried, a departure from the previous law. *   The Court found the High Court's interpretation too narrow. It reasoned that \"obtained a divorce\" should encompass situations where a wife legally procures a divorce through court proceedings under statutes like the 1939 Act, which provides a statutory right to dissolution. *   The Court also considered the various modes of divorce under Muslim law (unilateral husband's divorce, Khula/Mubarat, and judicial dissolution under the 1939 Act) and concluded that the Explanation to Section 125(1)(b) was intended to cover all these scenarios. *   It differentiated this from Section 127(3)(b), which deals with the cancellation of maintenance after divorce upon fulfillment of certain conditions related to dower, and Section 127(3)(c), which specifies conditions for cancellation when a wife obtains a divorce. The Court noted the distinct treatment of judicial divorce under Section 127(3)(c). *   The Court concluded that a dissolution of marriage obtained by the wife under the 1939 Act legally amounts to a divorce and falls under the definition of \"wife\" in Section 125(1)(b), thus entitling her to maintenance.",

The Court drew parallels with English and French legal principles and Indian case law emphasizing the necessity of publication for laws to be operative. *   **Inapplicability of Jaipur Laws Act:** The Jaipur Laws Act saved existing \"regulations,\" but this applied only to laws that had already acquired legal force. A resolution that was never properly promulgated did not constitute a valid \"regulation\" in force. *   **Irrelevance of 1938 Amendment:** The amendment in 1938 attempting to give the Act retrospective effect was irrelevant because the Act was not legally valid at its inception.

        "arguments": "*   Absence of the appellant's name in the initial complaint (FIR). *   Lack of direct evidence for the demand on November 20, 1974, due to the complainant's death. *   No prior arrangement for meeting time/place, suggesting a concocted story. *   Motbirs were \"petty clerks,\" potentially partisan and unreliable. *   Omissions in motbirs' evidence and possible contamination of phenolphthalein test by the raiding party. *   The appellant was an \"unwilling victim\" of a police trap. *   The presumption under Section 4(1) of the Prevention of Corruption Act should not be raised. *   The absence of the appellant's name in the FIR was explained by the possibility that the complainant knew him by his designation, not name, and the appellant himself admitted visiting Rajendra Dutt on the relevant date. *   While the FIR wasn't substantive evidence, circumstantial evidence (Rajendra Dutt's visit to the police, production of money, trap arrangement) strongly supported the demand. *   The motbirs' positions (clerk in a bank, teacher) did not automatically render them unreliable; the court emphasized that truth is not exclusive to the affluent or highly placed. *   The chemical test was not easily explained away by contamination, as the process of demonstration and application was detailed, and Rajendra Dutt's hands (which handled the money) were not suggested to have touched the appellant's hands during the search. *   The trap was a natural consequence of the alleged demand and refusal to pay, not an inducement. *   The presumption under Section 4(1) was applicable because the evidence indicated a voluntary acceptance of bribe money following a demand.",
        "decision": "The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal. It held that: *   The prosecution had proved the demand and acceptance of the bribe beyond a reasonable doubt. *   The evidence of the motbirs was reliable and corroborated by the recovery of marked currency notes and the positive phenolphthalein test. *   The appellant's defense was not plausible and had been rightly rejected. *   The presumption under Section 4(1) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947, was correctly applied to the facts of the case. *   The conviction and the minimum sentence awarded were upheld."

The Central Amendment Act, being a later law by Parliament on the \"same matter,\" impliedly repealed the West Bengal Amendment Act due to repugnancy.",
        "decision": "*   **Contrary Intention:** The Court found that the Central Amendment Act, by introducing new procedures (Section 16A for summary trials) and generally altering punishments for the same offences, manifested an intention to replace the old law. *   **Article 20(1) of the Constitution:** The Court distinguished between ex post facto laws that create new offences or increase punishment (prohibited by Article 20(1)) and those that mitigate the rigor of the law by reducing punishment. *   **Benefit of Reduced Punishment:** The Court held that while the Central Amendment Act could not be applied retrospectively to create new offences or enhance punishment, an accused should receive the benefit of reduced punishment provided by the new law for an existing offence. The rule of \"beneficial construction\" supports applying a law that mollifies the rigor of criminal law, even to pending cases. *   **Implied Repeal by Substitution:** The Court noted that when a later statute re-describes an offence and affixes a different punishment or varies the procedure, the earlier statute is repealed by implication, as the legislature intends the new Act to be substituted for the old. *   The Central Amendment Act of 1976 impliedly repealed the West Bengal Amendment Act of 1973. *   The new procedure introduced by Section 16A of the Central Amendment Act applies to pending proceedings for offences committed under the West Bengal Amendment Act. *   While the Central Amendment Act cannot be applied retrospectively to create new offences or increase punishment (due to Article 20(1)), the accused are entitled to the benefit of any *reduced* punishment provided by the Central Amendment Act."

The alleged actions of Respondent No. 2 did not fall into categories justifying withdrawal on these broader public policy grounds, especially as they were not politically motivated or linked to mass unrest. *   **Sufficiency of Evidence:** The Court examined the documentary evidence (Respondent No. 2's orders) and found it sufficient to make out a prima facie case for criminal misconduct and forgery.

This indicated a non-application of mind by both the Public Prosecutor and the Special Judge. **Ultimately, the Supreme Court held that the withdrawal from prosecution was not justified on merits or in law.** The grounds relied upon (political vendetta, reasons of state) were found irrelevant for the ordinary common law offenses charged, and the evidence indicated a prima facie case.

This contradicted the prosecution's timeline. *   The place of occurrence was disputed and likely not as alleged by the prosecution. The witnesses' stated positions made it improbable they could have seen the incident. *   The evidence regarding blood-stained earth was incomplete (serologist report not produced). *   The motive was questioned; the accused might have been falsely implicated due to the pending Section 498 IPC case filed by Babu. *   The High Court found the Sessions Court's doubts about the timeline and location to be unsubstantiated. *   It dismissed the idea that Ajudhya was falsely implicating the accused due to the other case, stating Ajudhya would be interested in bringing his son's killers to justice. *   It disagreed that the witnesses were not independent, despite being neighbors and belonging to the same caste as the deceased's father. *   The Supreme Court emphasized the principle that an appellate court should be slow to interfere with an acquittal, especially when the trial judge had the advantage of observing witness demeanor. *   It highlighted that if two plausible views of the evidence exist, the one favorable to the accused should be taken. *   The Court found the Sessions Judge's doubts to be \"weighty\" and \"plausible.\" *   It reiterated the cardinal rules for appeals against acquittal: presumption of innocence, favoring the accused when two views are possible, considering the trial judge's advantage, and giving benefit of reasonable doubt. *   The Supreme Court concluded that the Sessions Court's findings were fully justified and the High Court erred in setting aside the acquittal.",

Since his conviction, he has spent over two years as a remand prisoner and approximately eight years in solitary confinement, which was found to be contrary to established legal rulings.

        "issues": "",
        "arguments": "",
        "decision": "The Court extensively discussed Article 21 of the Constitution, interpreting it expansively following landmark cases like *Maneka Gandhi* and *Sunil Batra*. It established that Article 21, along with Articles 14 and 19, guarantees a procedure that is \"fair, just, and reasonable.\" This includes not only the trial and sentencing but also the carrying out of the sentence. The Court reasoned that prolonged detention awaiting execution, especially under conditions of solitary confinement, rendered the procedure unjust, unfair, and unreasonable. The Court also affirmed that fundamental rights are available to prisoners and that prison walls do not negate these rights. The Court held that prolonged delay in the execution of a death sentence, when it arises from factors beyond the condemned person's control, renders the punishment inhuman and degrading, thereby violating Article 21 of the Constitution. The Court deemed a delay exceeding two years in the execution of a death sentence, after making allowances for appeals and reprieve considerations, sufficient to invoke Article 21 and demand the quashing of the death sentence. The appeal was allowed, and the sentence of death was quashed. In its place, the Court substituted a sentence of **imprisonment for life**."

        "issues": "*   Whether migrant workmen employed on the Salal Hydro Electric Project were receiving the benefits and protections guaranteed by various labor laws. *   Specifically, the court examined the implementation of the Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act, 1956, and the Inter-State Migrant Workmen (Regulation of Employment and Conditions of Service) Act, 1979. *   Concerns were raised about bonded labor, payment of minimum wages, deductions from wages, working conditions, provision of welfare facilities (canteens, rest rooms, washing facilities), child labor, and the role of sub-contractors (\"piece wagers\") and intermediaries (\"khatedars\").",
        "arguments": "*   **Inter-State Migrant Workmen Act:** The Union of India argued delays in implementation due to the Act coming into force late and the subsequent slow setup of administrative machinery. The court rejected this, stating that from the Act's effective date (October 2, 1980), or at least from June 1982 when authorities were appointed, the provisions should have been enforced. The court found that Oriya workers, recruited by khatedars, clearly fell under the definition of \"inter-state migrant workmen.\" *   **Contract Labour Act:** The court noted that while principal contractors were licensed, \"piece wagers\" (sub-contractors) were operating without licenses, violating Section 12 of the Act and evading their obligations under Sections 16-21 (welfare facilities). The court emphasized that sub-contractors are included in the definition of \"contractor\" and must be licensed. *   **Welfare Facilities:** Reports indicated a lack of proper canteens, rest rooms, and washing facilities provided by contractors and \"piece wagers,\" despite statutory obligations. *   **Child Labour:** While no bonded labor was found, some minors were employed. The court acknowledged the economic reasons behind child labor but reiterated the constitutional prohibition against employing children under 14 in hazardous occupations like construction work. *   **Wages and Deductions:** The court found that while wages were generally paid, \"piece wagers\" and their intermediaries (\"khatedars\") were making unauthorized deductions from wages, especially from group-recruited laborers like Oriya workers. This practice, along with the non-supervision of wage disbursement by authorized representatives, was a violation of the Contract Labour Act. Overtime wages were also being improperly deducted. *   **Enforcement:** The court found the Central Government's inspections to be inadequate and infrequent, hindering effective enforcement of labor laws.",
        "decision": "The court directed the Central Government to take immediate steps to ensure compliance with labor laws, including: *   **Inter-State Migrant Workmen Act:** Identify and provide all benefits and protections to inter-state migrant workmen. *   **Contract Labour Act:** *   Ensure \"piece wagers\" (sub-contractors) obtain licenses. *   Enforce the provision of canteens, rest rooms, and washing facilities by all contractors and sub-contractors. *   Strictly enforce direct payment of wages (including overtime) to workmen without deductions, except those authorized by law. *   Ensure wage disbursement occurs in the presence of an authorized representative of the principal employer (NHPC or Central Government). *   **Child Labour:** While acknowledging economic realities, the court urged the Central Government to facilitate schooling for children of construction workers, including providing free educational resources. *   **Minimum Wage Discrepancy:** The court noted an anomaly where minimum wages were lower on the Central Government-run project (Rs. 9/day) compared to the state-mandated minimum wage in Jammu & Kashmir (Rs. 10/day). *   **Reporting:** The Central Government was ordered to submit a report by April 30, 1983, detailing the steps taken to implement these directions. *   **Further Hearing:** The petition was adjourned for further consideration after receiving the government's report."

        "arguments": "*   **Prosecution's Case:** The prosecution argued that a strong chain of circumstantial evidence pointed to the appellant's guilt.

It reasoned that the statement directly led to the discovery of specific stolen items from specific locations and individuals, and there was no prior knowledge of these specific locations by the police that would negate the \"fact discovered.\" *   **Presumption of Guilt:** The court held that the murder and robbery were part of the same transaction. The appellant's sudden disappearance, absconding for over a year, and the subsequent recovery of stolen items based on his statement, coupled with his lack of explanation and false denial, led to the presumption that he committed both the murder and the robbery. The period of one year was not considered too long for the presumption given the appellant's absconding status and the nature of the stolen items. *   **Sentence:** While acknowledging the brutality of the crime and the appellant's betrayal of trust, the court found itself bound by the precedent in *Bachan Singh v.

However, the presence and participation of accused Nos. 3 to 9 in the incident were considered proven, corroborated by the recovery of firearms that matched spent cartridges from the scene. *   **FIR Omission:** The court addressed the omission of some accused's names in the initial FIR, noting that this didn't automatically lead to acquittal but required explanation, which was partially covered by the injured witnesses' testimony. *   **Sentencing:** The court considered the ages of the accused, finding that younger individuals, like accused Nos. 3, 6, and 7 (aged 18-19), deserved leniency compared to older convicts. The court also found it difficult to assign specific culpability to each individual when a large group was involved and evidence was mixed.",
        "decision": "*   **Acquittal:** Accused Nos. 1 and 2 were acquitted of all charges due to insufficient evidence, as the conspiracy evidence was discounted and they were not present at the scene. *   **Conviction Upheld:** The convictions of Accused Nos. 3 to 9 under Section 302 read with Section 149 of the Penal Code were upheld, as their presence and participation in the incident were proven. *   **Sentencing Modifications:** *   The death sentences imposed on Accused Nos. 1 (who was acquitted), 3, 6, and 7 were set aside and commuted to life imprisonment, primarily due to their young age and the difficulty in attributing specific acts. *   The death sentence imposed on Accused No. 5 was also set aside and commuted to life imprisonment, as he was not deemed the leader and the court found no justification for the death penalty over life imprisonment. *   The life imprisonment sentence imposed on Accused No. 4 was confirmed. *   The life imprisonment sentences imposed on Accused Nos. 8 and 9 were confirmed.

        "issues": "*   The Court then extensively discussed the **burden of proof**. It distinguished between challenges under Article 14 (equality) and challenges under Articles 19 (freedoms) and 21 (life and liberty). For Articles 19 and 21, once the infringement of a fundamental right is shown, the burden shifts to the State to justify the law or action as constitutional, fair, just, and reasonable. *   The Court then examined **extensive expert evidence, reports from commissions (UK Royal Commission, Indian Law Commission), and opinions of medical and legal experts** regarding the method of hanging. This evidence generally supported hanging as a quick, certain, and humane method, especially with modern improvements, leading to instantaneous death through spinal cord dislocation. *   Alternative methods like electrocution, lethal gas, and lethal injection were considered and found to have their own drawbacks, including potential for malfunction, complexity, cost, and uncertainty of being more humane. *   The Court analyzed the historical development of the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment and compared it with Article 21. *   It concluded that while the execution process must be humane, avoiding torture and degradation, the mere extinguishment of life itself, when lawfully imposed, is not prohibited by Article 21. The concept of \"cruelty\" evolves with societal standards. *   The Court held that the **burden of proof lies on the State** to demonstrate that the method of execution prescribed by Section 354(5) of the Code of Criminal Procedure is just, fair, and reasonable, and not harsh, cruel, or degrading. *   Based on the extensive material and expert evidence presented, the Court found that the **State had discharged this burden**. *   The Court held that the method of hanging, as currently practiced with improvements, is a **quick, certain, and humane** method of execution, causing the least possible pain and avoiding degradation or barbarity. It does not violate Article 21.",
        "arguments": "*   Hanging is inherently cruel and barbaric, regardless of legal sanction. *   Article 21 prohibits causing any pain or suffering during the execution of a sentence, especially the death sentence. *   The State has a constitutional obligation to provide a humane and dignified method of execution, which hanging fails to do. *   If the prescribed method is unconstitutional, no death sentence can be executed as the court cannot substitute another method. *   A lawfully imposed sentence must be executed. *   Hanging is a humane method involving the least pain and suffering. *   Article 21 does not mandate the complete absence of pain during execution. *   The writ petitions were **dismissed**. *   The orders staying the executions of death sentences were vacated, except for one petition (W.P.

If it is not, the complaint must be filed within the prescribed limitation period under the Code of Criminal Procedure.",
        "arguments": "*   The Court noted that \"continuing offence\" is not defined but explained it as an offence susceptible of continuance, distinguishable from one committed \"once and for all.\" It involves a failure to obey a rule or requirement, with liability continuing until compliance.",
        "decision": "*   The Court distinguished these from the case of *State of Bihar vs. Deokaran Nenshi*, where failure to furnish annual returns was held to be a non-continuing offence. *   Crucially, the Court emphasized that the **object and purpose** of the Provident Fund Act is the welfare of workers. The failure to pay employer contributions goes against the \"very grain\" of the statute. *   The Court held that the employer has the power to pay the contribution at any time after the due date. Each day the obligation remains unfulfilled, a fresh offence is committed. *   The Court found it unacceptable to allow employers to evade penal consequences for not paying contributions by pleading limitation. Such offences must be treated as continuing ones. *   The Court also noted that even if a limitation period were applicable, Section 473 of the Code allows courts to take cognizance of an offence after the limitation period if it's in the interest of justice, which is often the case for worker welfare provisions. *   **Continuing Offence:** The Court held that the offence of non-payment of the employer's contribution to the Provident Fund is a **continuing offence**. *   **Limitation Period Inapplicable:** Consequently, the period of limitation prescribed by Section 468 of the Code of Criminal Procedure does not apply. *   **Fresh Limitation Period:** Under Section 472 of the Code, a fresh period of limitation begins to run at every moment during which the offence continues. *   **Dismissal of Appeals:** The appeals filed by the Directors and Factory Manager were dismissed. *   **Prosecution to Proceed:** The prosecutions were ordered to proceed and be disposed of expeditiously. The Magistrate was directed to consider all points together, not as preliminary ones."

        "arguments": "*   **Borstal System:** The Court explained the historical context and purpose of the Borstal system, which aims to reform young offenders by providing training and a different environment than prisons. *   **Borstal Schools vs. Prisons:** The Court emphasized that Borstal Schools are corrective institutions, not prisons, and detention therein is not \"imprisonment.\" The detention is for reformation and has a limited term (not exceeding five years or beyond age 23). *   **Section 10A of the Act:** This section allows the State Government to transfer offenders sentenced to life imprisonment, who were between 16-21 years at conviction, to Borstal Schools to serve the remainder of their sentence. The Act states that provisions of the Borstal Schools Act apply as if the offender was originally sentenced to detention in a Borstal School. *   **Section 433A of the Code:** This section restricts the release of individuals sentenced to life imprisonment for offenses punishable by death, requiring them to serve at least 14 years. *   **Conflict of Laws:** The State argued that Section 433A, being a later central legislation, should prevail over the State's Borstal Schools Act. *   **Court's Interpretation:** *   The Court found that Section 10A, when read with Section 8, limits detention in a Borstal School to a maximum of five years and no later than the offender reaching 23 years of age. *   The Court held that being transferred to a Borstal School under Section 10A means the offender ceases to be a \"prisoner undergoing imprisonment\" as referred to in Section 433A. They become \"detenus\" in a Borstal School. *   The Borstal Schools Act is a special local law dealing with a specific class of offenders (adolescent offenders) and its provisions should be given full effect. *   The Court distinguished Section 10A from remission rules and provisions for reducing sentences (which Section 433A aims to curb). Section 10A is about a different mode of detention for reformation. *   The Court applied the principle of interpreting deeming provisions (\"as if\") to ensure that all benefits available to offenders under Section 8 are also available to those transferred under Section 10A. This includes the age limit of 23. *   The Court concluded that Section 433A does not apply to persons detained in Borstal Schools under Section 10A because they are not undergoing \"imprisonment\" in a \"prison\" in the sense contemplated by Section 433A. *   The purpose of Section 433A was to prevent arbitrary remission of sentences for \"lifers,\" not to nullify beneficial provisions for adolescent offenders like those in the Borstal Schools Act.",

They appealed, arguing they should benefit from Section 428 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), which allows for the period of pre-conviction detention (as undertrial prisoners) to be set off against their sentence. The Delhi High Court had rejected Bhagirath's petition based on a previous Supreme Court ruling (Kartar Singh), stating Section 428 only applies to sentences \"for a term,\" and life imprisonment is not considered a term. Rakesh Kaushik presented a similar grievance and also argued for the benefit of Sections 432 and 433 of the CrPC.",

The word \"term\" in Section 428 does not require a \"fixed\" or \"ascertainable\" period. *   The marginal note of Section 428 indicates its purpose is to set off detention against any imposed sentence, supporting a broad interpretation. *   Denying Section 428 benefits to life convicts would exclude a large number of cases where it would be most needed and justified. *   While Section 57 of the Penal Code equates life imprisonment to twenty years for calculating fractions of punishment, this is for a specific purpose and cannot be used to exclude life imprisonment from Section 428.",

The Court found the letter merely requested investigation and a detailed report, not a waiver of court-martial jurisdiction, and that the prescribed Rules must be followed for such an option to be relevant. *   **Applicability of Central Act to West Bengal:** The State argued the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 1952, was not applicable due to West Bengal's own Act. The Court clarified that both governments can legislate on criminal law (concurrent list). While West Bengal's Act excluded certain sections of the Central Act, it did not conflict with provisions concerning Army personnel and Section 549 Cr.P.C. procedures. Therefore, the Central Act, including Section 8(3A), remained applicable to Special Judges in West Bengal for these matters. *   The Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 1952, including its provisions on Special Judges, was found to be applicable to West Bengal. *   The High Court's \"acquittal\" was not on merits but due to a lack of jurisdiction. The competent authority could still decide to re-try the accused following the correct procedure.",
        "decision": "The Supreme Court **dismissed the appeal** filed by the State of West Bengal. The Court held that: *   The High Court was correct in quashing the trial proceedings because the Special Court Judge failed to follow the mandatory procedure prescribed by the Criminal Courts and Court Martial (Adjustment of Jurisdiction) Rules, 1952. *   This failure to follow the Rules meant the ordinary criminal court lacked initial jurisdiction to take cognizance of the case, rendering the trial null and void."

Dr. Jagannath Misra, a former Chief Minister of Bihar, was implicated for allegedly using his office to shield Nawal Kishore Sinha from prosecution and potentially for personal gain. A significant portion of the case revolves around actions taken by Dr. Jagannath Misra while in power, including the alleged alteration of official orders to protect Sinha and a subsequent directive to withdraw the prosecution against himself and others.

        "arguments": "*   **State's Position:** The State's primary objective was to obtain a ruling on the scope of Section 3(1), not necessarily to pursue the prosecution. *   **Supreme Court's Analysis:** *   The Court examined the wording of Section 3(1) (\"suitable for use on roads,\" \"kept in the State\") and Section 4 (advance payment of tax). *   It cited precedents that interpret \"suitable for use on roads\" as descriptive of the vehicle's design, not its current condition. *   The Court emphasized the **Explanation to Section 3(1)**: A vehicle with a current Registration Certificate is *deemed* suitable for use and therefore liable for tax. This deeming provision makes the liability absolute as long as the Registration Certificate is current. *   The Court distinguished the relied-upon cases (*Bhagwan*, *Naraina Reddy*) and found they did not support the interpretation that fitness certificate validity dictates tax liability. *   The Court clarified that Section 38 of the Motor Vehicles Act (dealing with fitness certificates) has a limited scope, applying only to Section 22 of that Act (necessity for registration to drive). It does not extend to the Taxation Act. Section 38 is a safety measure, while Section 3(1) of the Taxation Act is a compensatory measure. *   **Refund Mechanism:** The Court highlighted **Section 7** of the Taxation Act, which provides for a refund of tax if the vehicle was not used for a specified period. This mechanism protects owners from paying tax for non-use, negating the need for tax liability to be conditional on fitness. *   The Court concluded that the scheme of the Act mandates paying tax in advance based on a current Registration Certificate, with the option to claim a refund for non-use. The State does not need to prove the vehicle's condition or use.",
        "decision": "*   **High Court Dismissal:** The State's appeal against the acquittal was dismissed by the High Court. *   **Supreme Court Appeal:** The State appealed to the Supreme Court. *   **General Principle:** The Supreme Court held that tax liability under Section 3(1) of the Motor Vehicles Taxation Act is attracted as long as the vehicle's Certificate of Registration is current. This is regardless of whether the vehicle is actually in use or possesses a valid Certificate of Fitness. *   **Rejection of Lower Courts' Interpretation:** The interpretation by the Magistrate and High Court, based on the *Reddappa* case, that tax liability is conditional on the vehicle being \"kept for use\" and having a valid fitness certificate, was **incorrect**. *   **Refund Provision:** Owners not using their vehicles are entitled to a refund under Section 7, which is the proper recourse, rather than avoiding tax payment altogether. *   **Impact of Legislative Change:** The Court noted that a legislative amendment had made the debate on \"kept in the State\" vs. \"kept for use\" academic. *   **Appeal Outcome:** *   The Supreme Court **allowed the appeal** in terms of clarifying the scope and effect of Section 3(1) and its Explanation. *   However, the **acquittal of the respondents was left undisturbed** because the State was not keen on pursuing the prosecution, and it was reported that one of the respondents had died.

        "issues": "*   A secondary contention raised by the appellants was that no fish were found on board, and nets were not wet, thus no presumption of fishing in violation of the Act could be made.",

The amendment broadened the scope, and for the purposes of the Act, railway servants are considered public servants. *   **Trap Cases:** While acknowledging concerns about police creating opportunities for crime, the court stated that traps cannot be absolutely prohibited as they are necessary for detecting offenses like corruption.

This screening is for departmental action, not for replacing criminal investigation under the Cr.P.C. *   The Court noted that Section 36 of the Police Act explicitly states that nothing in the Act prevents prosecution under other laws, and Section 42 (though not directly applicable here) illustrated the principle that specific provisions of the Police Act do not preclude other legal actions. *   The Court found the Full Bench's interpretation that the Police Rules override the Cr.P.C. to be erroneous. *   The Court held that Rule 16.38 of the Punjab Police Rules **does not apply to criminal prosecutions** for offences under the Indian Penal Code and other Acts; it is primarily intended for departmental enquiries. *   The Court affirmed that the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code take precedence over the Punjab Police Rules in matters of criminal prosecution."

While waiting for another friend, Tohid, the deceased went to drink water from a well. At that moment, shots were fired from a \"Bari\" (a plot of land/garden) on the north side, hitting him in the chest and hand. The prosecution alleged that the appellants, Brajendra and Awadhesh, along with Kailash, were seen running away armed with guns. Rajendra Singh and Chhotey Bhaiya also fired shots in retaliation.",

        "arguments": "*   **Supreme Court's Stance on Appeals Against Acquittal:** The Court emphasized that while High Courts have broad powers in appeals against acquittal, they must exercise caution, giving due weight to the trial court's assessment of witness credibility, the presumption of innocence, the benefit of doubt, and the advantage the trial judge has in seeing the witnesses. If two reasonable conclusions can be drawn from the evidence, the appellate court should generally not disturb an acquittal. *   **Doubts Raised by the Trial Court (and upheld by the Supreme Court):** *   **Delay and Contradictions in FIR:** The Court found significant discrepancies in the timeline of the FIR lodging and contradictory statements from the eye witness (Rajendra Singh PW 14) and the investigating officer regarding where and when the FIR was recorded. This suggested the assailants' names were not known initially, leading to a delayed and deliberated lodging of the report. *   **Unnatural Conduct of Witnesses:** The court found it highly improbable that when Tohid arrived at the scene shortly after the incident, neither he nor the eye witnesses discussed or revealed the names of the assailants, despite the deceased's dead body being present and their prior friendship. This indicated that the eye witnesses likely didn't see the actual occurrence. *   **Recovery of Cartridges:** The recovery of empty cartridges was made a day after the incident, not at the time of the occurrence. The witnesses to the recovery did not support the prosecution. Furthermore, no effort was made to connect the recovered cartridges to the appellants' weapons through ballistic examination, leading the court to suspect they were planted. *   **Lack of Independent Witnesses:** Despite the incident occurring at a busy public place with employees, Home Guards, and residents present, no independent witnesses testified for the prosecution. High-ranking officials who reached the scene also did not depose. *   **Interested Witnesses:** The testimony of two witnesses (Udai Singh and Kali Charan) who claimed to see the appellants running away was dismissed due to their delay in making statements and their close relationship with the deceased, making their presence and testimony doubtful. *   **Medical Evidence Inconsistency:** The post-mortem report and the doctor's testimony regarding the direction and nature of the gunshot wounds were inconsistent with the eye witnesses' account of the assailants' positions and the terrain. The medical evidence suggested the shots were fired from a higher level to a lower level, contradicting the prosecution's claim that the assailants were on a lower level firing upwards.",

        "arguments": "*   **Child Witness Testimony:** The Court referenced Sections 5 and 13 of the Oaths Act and Section 118 of the Evidence Act. It was argued that an omission to administer an oath (or an irregularity) does not invalidate evidence or render it inadmissible. The primary test for competency is whether the witness understands the questions and can give rational answers. While formal recording of the judge's opinion is desirable, it can be inferred from circumstances. The Court noted that the child's tender years, demeanour, and the fact the accused's counsel did not object supported admissibility. *   **Corroboration Requirement:** The Court clarified that while it's a strong rule of prudence to seek corroboration in cases involving sexual offences (especially with adult complainants or accomplices), it is not a strict rule of law that mandates corroboration for conviction. The rule of prudence must be present in the judge's mind, but it can be dispensed with if the judge (or jury) is satisfied that it is safe to convict without it, considering the specific circumstances. The tender age of the child, coupled with other factors, can make corroboration unnecessary. *   **Statement to Mother as Corroboration:** Section 157 of the Evidence Act allows previous statements of a witness to be proved to corroborate their testimony if made \"at or about the time when the fact took place.\" The Court found that the statement made four hours later, after the child returned home and found her mother, was sufficiently prompt given the circumstances and the child's natural instinct to go to her mother. Illustration (j) to Section 8 of the Evidence Act also makes such complaints relevant. The mother, despite being related, was considered an \"independent\" witness for corroboration purposes as she had no apparent motive to falsely implicate the accused.",
        "decision": "*   The Court held that the child victim's testimony was admissible, even though an oath was not administered, as she understood the duty to speak the truth and the judge implicitly considered her competent. *   The Court held that corroboration is a rule of prudence, not a strict rule of law, in rape cases, especially involving children. It can be dispensed with if the judge is satisfied it is safe to do so. *   The child victim's statement to her mother, made within a reasonable time after the incident, was deemed legally admissible as corroboration under Section 157 of the Evidence Act. *   The Court found that, in this specific case, the High Court was justified in considering the statement to the mother sufficient corroboration and in convicting the accused."

        "arguments": "*   **Motive:** The appellant presented a will from his father leaving land to him, undermining the prosecution's motive. The court found no evidence of bad relations between father and son. The suggestion that the murder occurred to prevent the will from being changed was considered speculative. *   **Extra-Judicial Confession:** The court considered this weak evidence, noting the circumstances of the confession and the lack of corroboration or indication that Amrik Singh had influence with the police. *   **\"Last Seen\" Evidence:** The appellant's defense that his father and son went with Manjit Singh was not disproven by the prosecution, as Manjit Singh and the appellant's sister were not examined. This weakened the prosecution's claim that the sighting at the Gurudwara was the last time they were seen before their death. *   **Recovery of Bodies:** The court found that the field where the bodies were found was an open place, and the prosecution did not establish exclusive knowledge of the appellant about the location. The investigator admitted not knowing the exact location initially, suggesting information was received from Amrik Singh. The bodies were significantly decomposed, making identification difficult. *   **Recovery of Belongings:** The recovery of the deceased's belongings from their usual residence was considered insignificant and did not draw any adverse inference against the appellant.",

This was reportedly done by an impersonator. *   Islam disappeared and his body was later recovered from a waterlogged pond. *   The High Court upheld the conviction and sentence for appellant No. 1 but reduced the sentence for appellant No. 2 to one under Section 201 IPC.",

The scribe identified the impersonator and a witness, but the witness who supposedly impersonated Islam did not clearly identify the document or the persons involved. Expert opinion on thumb impressions was not obtained. *   **Last Seen Evidence:** The testimony of Shabbir (PW 1) about the deceased's clothing when he was last seen with the appellants was deemed unreliable. Shabbir and Islam lived separately, and it was questionable why Islam would go with the appellants against the advice of his mother and brother, especially if it was for a marriage arrangement without their involvement. Other witnesses who allegedly saw Islam leave did not corroborate the details of his clothing. *   **Body Recovery and Identification:** The post-mortem examination was conducted over three months after the alleged disappearance, and the doctor could not determine the cause or duration of death due to the decomposed state of the body. The identification of the recovered clothes (shirt and tahmad) was criticized as a \"farce.\" Shabbir was called to identify the clothes and body much later, and the identification seemed to rely on superficial features like a \"paper chit\" on the shirt and a \"knot\" on the tahmad, rather than a proper examination. The Sub Inspector had already removed, washed, and packed the clothes separately, making it impossible for Shabbir to have seen the body with the clothes as claimed.",

        "arguments": "*   **Detention while in Custody:** The Court acknowledged that a detention order can be passed against someone already in custody, but emphasized the need for awareness of this fact and \"compelling reasons\" to justify preventive detention. The grounds of detention must clearly show both the detaining authority's awareness of the existing custody and the necessity for further preventive detention. The Court found the grounds of detention in this case sufficiently addressed these requirements. *   **Bailable vs. Non-bailable Offence:** The Court held that whether the underlying offense is bailable or non-bailable has no bearing on the validity of a preventive detention order. The possibility of bail or the nature of the offense does not preclude preventive detention if compelling reasons exist. *   **Delay in Representations:** The Court reviewed the timeline for processing the representations and found the delays explained, particularly in relation to the Advisory Board's hearing. While acknowledging a statement in an affidavit was inaccurate regarding the detaining authority's rejection of a representation, the Court found no substantial prejudice or lack of independent consideration. The representations were disposed of before the Advisory Board's report, negating the claim of influence. *   **Delayed Document Supply:** The Court accepted the respondents' contention that the requested documents were supplied along with the grounds of detention, and the appellant's claim of delay was factually unfounded. *   **Maximum Detention Period:** The Court ruled that Section 10 of the Act does not mandate specific reasons for imposing the maximum detention period.

His role as a metal examiner did not fit this narrow definition. *   The court examined the definition of \"public servant\" under Section 2 of the PCA, which refers to Section 21 of the IPC.

It reasoned that cognizance of offenses under the Wild Life Protection Act could *only* be taken upon a complaint filed by a specific authorized officer (as per Section 55 of the Act). Since cognizance could only be taken in this specific manner, there was no possibility of taking cognizance \"more than once\" or in a manner that would trigger Section 210. *   **On Merits:** The Court found the High Court's assessment of the complaint to be an impermissible exercise of power under Section 482 Cr.P.C. It emphasized that the High Court should not inquire into the evidence at the stage of cognizance but only determine if the allegations, *taken as they are*, constitute an offense. The Court found that the complaint *did* set out the ingredients of the offense. *   **On \"Same Offense\":** The Court analyzed Section 56 of the Wild Life Protection Act, which allows prosecution under other laws but prohibits punishment twice for the \"same offense.\" It examined the concept of \"same offense\" in light of various legal provisions and case law. The Court concluded that the ingredients of an offense under the Wild Life Protection Act were not identical to those under Section 429 IPC. Even if the facts were similar, if the legal ingredients of the offenses were distinct, prosecution under both could be permissible, provided the prohibition against double punishment for the *same* offense was respected. The Court noted that there had been no prior conviction under Section 429 IPC in this case anyway.",

The killings of the infants occurred when accused 1 and 2 were frustrated after PW 6 escaped their reach.

This confession was retracted in the Court of Session but was deemed voluntary and truthful by the court. *   **Retracted Confession and Co-accused:** The court examined Section 30 of the Indian Evidence Act, ruling that a retracted confession, while permissible to be considered against a co-accused, requires strong corroboration. *   **Voluntariness of Confession:** The court found that the Magistrate took extensive precautions to ensure Prem's confession was voluntary, despite Prem being in police custody prior to making it. *   **Truthfulness of Confession:** Prem's confession was consistent with his statement to the Committing Magistrate and was corroborated by various circumstances, including his presence at the house around the time of the murder and his evasive answers about locked doors. *   **Corroboration Connecting Appellant:** *   **Dagger:** A blood-stained dagger was recovered from the appellant's belongings, which medical evidence suggested could have inflicted the victim's injuries, though its origin couldn't be definitively determined due to delay. *   **Ornaments:** Crucially, the deceased's missing ornaments were recovered from the appellant's mistress, Raj Rani, based on a statement made by the appellant himself.

While village authorities were persons in authority, there was no evidence of any inducement, threat, or promise that would render the confession irrelevant under Section 24 of the Evidence Act. The court noted that the appellant had a guilty mind in other interactions (offering money and a goat to avoid arrest).

Therefore, Badri's statement on August 31, made in furtherance of this conspiracy and acting as Ramji's agent, was admissible against Ramji. *   Regarding the timing of the statement, the Court held that the act of offering the bribe and the statement explaining its purpose were part of the same transaction and that the object of the conspiracy (hushing up the case) was not yet accomplished at the time of the statement.

        "issues": "*   Whether inordinate delay in investigation, by itself, is a sufficient ground for quashing a First Information Report (FIR) and subsequent criminal proceedings. *   Whether the High Court was justified in quashing the FIR solely on the ground of delay.",
        "arguments": "*   **Appellant (State):** Argued that the High Court's broad statement that \"wherever there is an inordinate delay... the case merits quashing of the First Information Report\" was too wide and detrimental to future prosecutions. *   **Respondent (Officer):** Claimed the delay caused him undue stress and prejudice, and that the lack of progress in filing the investigation report justified quashing the FIR. *   The Court acknowledged that undue delay can cause mental stress to an accused and that courts have a duty to protect personal liberty. *   However, it stated that a mere delay is not an automatic ground for quashing proceedings. *   The determination of whether delay justifies quashing depends on various factors: whether the delay was unreasonably long, intentional, or caused by the accused's tactics, and if it caused grave prejudice to the accused. *   Offences of a complex or grave nature may naturally require longer investigation times. *   Therefore, no inflexible rule or arbitrary time limit can be set for investigations. *   Regarding the specific case, the Court noted several critical facts: the respondent had retired from service, and crucially, the sanction for prosecution was granted *after* the High Court had already quashed the FIR.",
        "decision": "*   Separately, there were other proceedings concerning the respondent's suspension, reinstatement, and subsequent move towards compulsory retirement, which eventually led to his peaceful retirement from service. *   The Supreme Court **dismissed** the State's appeal. *   The Court **did not agree** with the High Court's broad proposition that inordinate delay *ipso facto* warrants quashing an FIR. It clarified that delay must be assessed in conjunction with other factors, including prejudice to the accused and the reasons for the delay. *   However, given the factual circumstances of the case (specifically, the respondent's retirement and the timing of the sanction for prosecution), the Court held that it was **not a fit case for interference** with the High Court's order. The appeal was dismissed on these grounds."

        "arguments": "*   The Act is not applicable as the incident occurred on a foreign ship in international waters, outside India's territorial jurisdiction. *   Even if applicable, it doesn't constitute a \"shipping casualty\" as defined in Part XII. *   The complaint was improperly filed by the Principal Officer and lacked the necessary prerequisites under Section 363. *   The Act is applicable because India's territorial waters extend up to 200 nautical miles (this was disputed). *   The High Court correctly refused to quash the proceedings. *   **Territorial Waters:** The court clarified that India's territorial waters are limited to 12 nautical miles from the baseline, not 200 nautical miles (which refers to the Exclusive Economic Zone). Since the casualty occurred beyond this limit, Section 2 of the Act's application to foreign vessels is not met. *   **Shipping Casualty:** The definition of \"shipping casualty\" in Section 358 primarily concerns incidents \"on or near the coasts of India\" or involving \"any Indian ship.\" The incident did not fit these criteria. *   **Section 363 Analysis:** The court meticulously analyzed Section 363, noting it applies when the Central Government has reason to believe grounds exist for charging incompetency or misconduct \"otherwise than in the course of a formal investigation into shipping casualty.\" It also requires the Central Government to transmit a statement of the case. *   **Deficiencies in Complaint:** The complaint failed to demonstrate that the Central Government had formed the necessary belief or that it had transmitted a statement of the case.

They emphasized that the husband's conduct pushed her to an extreme, desperate situation. *   **Defence (Accused):** The defence argued that the prosecution evidence did not establish the ingredients of abetment. They pointed to a divorce deed suggesting the wife was keen to end the marriage and a letter that could imply suicide due to harassment by a school Headmaster. *   The Court acknowledged that direct evidence of abetment is often difficult to obtain in such cases. *   It considered the deceased's letters as crucial evidence, detailing her suffering and apprehension of harm. *   The Court noted the history of marital discord dating back to 1977, including a prior police complaint and a divorce deed that, despite its wording, reflected an unhappy marriage and apprehension of harm. *   It analyzed Section 306 IPC and the definition of \"abetment,\" which includes instigation, conspiracy, and intentional aiding. *   The Court discussed recent legislative changes (Sections 498A IPC, 113A Evidence Act, 304B IPC, 113B Evidence Act) aimed at curbing dowry-related offenses and allowing for presumptions of cruelty and abetment under specific circumstances. *   While these specific amendments were noted, the Court focused on the existing Section 306 IPC. *   The Court concluded that the husband's persistent dowry demands, the physical abuse, and the overall creation of an atmosphere of terror and desperation directly led to the deceased's extreme step. His conduct amounted to intentionally creating a situation that drove her to suicide. *   Regarding the sister, the Court found insufficient evidence to prove her involvement beyond a reasonable doubt, especially as there was no proof of her presence at the husband's residence immediately before the incident.",

        "arguments": "*   Judges of the higher judiciary are constitutional functionaries with special status and protections under the Constitution (Articles 124, 217, 218). *   The mechanism for removing Judges (impeachment by Parliament) is distinct from typical executive removal, suggesting they are not subject to ordinary executive oversight or prosecution procedures. *   Section 6 of the Act requires sanction from the \"authority competent to remove him from his office.\" For Judges, this process is complex (Parliamentary address, Presidential order), and Parliament is unsuitable as a sanctioning authority. *   The structure of Section 6 implies a \"vertical hierarchy\" and master-servant relationship, which doesn't exist between Judges and the President. *   The specific offense of criminal misconduct under Section 5(1)(e) requires the public servant to be given an opportunity to account for assets, which was allegedly not done. *   The Act was not intended to apply to superior Judges, and applying it would undermine judicial independence. *   The definition of \"public servant\" under Section 2 of the Act (referencing Section 21 of the IPC) explicitly includes \"Every Judge,\" making it applicable to all Judges, including those of the Supreme Court and High Courts. *   Unlike the President and Governors, Judges do not have constitutional immunity from criminal proceedings during their term of office (Article 361). *   **Judges as Public Servants:** Judges of the Supreme Court and High Courts are indeed \"public servants\" under Section 21 of the IPC and thus under the Act. *   **Applicability of the Act:** The Act is intended to cover all public servants. While Judges have constitutional protections, they are not entirely immune from prosecution for corruption. *   **Sanctioning Authority:** The crucial question is identifying the \"authority competent to remove\" a Judge for the purpose of Section 6(1)(c). *   Parliament (address) and the President (order) are involved in removal. *   The majority concluded that the **President of India** is the competent authority, as the final order for removal comes from the President, even though it follows a Parliamentary address. *   To safeguard judicial independence, the Court directed that the **Chief Justice of India** must be consulted before any criminal case is registered against a Judge or Chief Justice, and the President should generally act on the Chief Justice's advice regarding sanction. In cases against the Chief Justice of India, consultation with other Supreme Court Judges is required. *   **Ingredients of Section 5(1)(e):** The Court explained the ingredients of the offence, clarifying that the prosecution must prove possession of disproportionate assets. The burden then shifts to the accused to \"satisfactorily account\" for them, which can be discharged on a balance of probabilities. The charge sheet need not contain an averment that the accused was asked to account for the assets; the investigation officer's role is to collect evidence, not to conduct a judicial inquiry. *   **Sanction Post-Retirement:** The Court unanimously held that **no prior sanction under Section 6 is necessary** if the accused has retired and ceased to be a public servant at the time the court takes cognizance of the offense. This principle, established in prior cases, was deemed unassailable. **Dissenting Opinion (Verma, J.):** *   Argued that the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947, does **not apply** to Judges of the High Courts and Supreme Court.",

The appellant counted the money and gave it to Khalilur Rahman. *   The complainant also executed a promissory note for Rs. 70 in favor of the appellant, promising to pay the balance after selling the paddy. *   Both Khalilur Rahman and the appellant were convicted by the Special Judge. *   The High Court acquitted Khalilur Rahman but upheld the appellant's conviction. *   The complainant then approached the appellant for the refund and return of the promissory note, which was not done. *   The complainant lodged a complaint with the Deputy Commissioner, detailing the bribe and promissory note.",
        "issues": "*   Can the appellant be convicted for abetment of an offense under Section 165A IPC when the principal offender (Khalilur Rahman) has been acquitted? *   Does the acquittal of the alleged principal offender automatically invalidate the conviction for abetment? *   Was the appellant guilty of abetment by intentionally aiding the commission of the offense under Section 161 IPC, even if the bribe was not ultimately paid to Khalilur Rahman?",
        "arguments": "*   The Court acknowledged that for abetment, the offense does not necessarily need to be committed. However, abetment requires instigation, conspiracy, or intentional aid. *   The Court noted that the prosecution did not establish instigation or conspiracy. The appellant's role, according to the complainant, was to receive money at Khalilur Rahman's direction and count it, then pass it back to Khalilur Rahman. *   The High Court found that the money was paid to the appellant but not necessarily to Khalilur Rahman. *   The Court referenced Section 107 of the IPC defining abetment, particularly \"intentionally aids.\" *   Crucially, the Court stated that if Khalilur Rahman was acquitted, implying the Section 161 offense was not proven to have been committed, then the question of \"intentionally aiding\" the commission of that offense by the appellant becomes problematic.",
        "decision": "*   The Court distinguished the cited precedent (Dalip Singh vs State of Punjab) as being based on unique circumstances. *   The Court concluded that given the High Court's finding that Khalilur Rahman was not proven to have received the bribe, and thus the Section 161 offense was not established, the appellant could not be held guilty of abetment by intentionally aiding, as there was no proven offense to aid. *   The Court **allowed** the appeal. *   The conviction and sentence of the appellant under Section 165A IPC were **set aside**. *   The bail bonds of the appellant were discharged. *   The Court held that on the facts found and circumstances established, and with Khalilur Rahman having been acquitted, the appellant's conviction for abetment could not be upheld."

P.C.), which mandates concurrent life sentences.",
        "issues": "",
        "arguments": "*   The Court first clarified that a writ under Article 32 of the Constitution was not maintainable as the petitioner's imprisonment stemmed from a valid judicial order, not a fundamental rights violation. *   The Court reaffirmed the established legal principle (from cases like *Gopal Vinayak Godse* and *Maru Ram*) that \"life imprisonment\" means for the natural life of the convict, unless commuted or remitted. *   It distinguished between Section 427(1) (offender undergoing a fixed term sentence) and Section 427(2) (offender undergoing life imprisonment). *   The Court explained that Section 427(2) is an exception to the general rule in Section 427(1) where subsequent sentences usually run consecutively unless directed otherwise. Since a life sentence lasts indefinitely, a subsequent sentence *must* run concurrently to avoid essentially adding to a finite lifespan, which is impossible. *   However, the Court then analyzed its own 1983 direction. It interpreted the phrase \"in case any remission or commutation in respect of his earlier sentence is granted to him the present sentence should commence thereafter\" not as making the sentences consecutive, but as clarifying that any remission or commutation granted for the *first* life sentence would *not automatically* apply to the second. To get the benefit of remission for the second sentence, it would need to be granted separately. This was the Court's way of ensuring the subsequent sentence wasn't simply wiped out by remissions on the first, effectively making them run \"concurrently\" in principle but with specific conditions on remission benefits. *   The Court concluded that, when interpreted in this manner, its 1983 direction *did* harmonize with Section 427(2) Cr. P.C. *   Furthermore, the Court noted that even if the sentences were to run concurrently, the petitioner had not yet served the mandatory minimum 14 years of actual imprisonment required by Section 433A Cr. P.C. (a point established in *Maru Ram*), which would prevent his release under Article 32.",
        "decision": "*   The petitioner sought release on the grounds that both life sentences should have run concurrently and he had served the requisite minimum sentence. *   The petition for a writ under Article 32 was dismissed as untenable. *   The Court clarified that its 1983 direction, while appearing to delay the start of the second life sentence, was intended to mean that any remission or commutation granted for the first life sentence would not automatically apply to the second. The second sentence would commence only if such remission or commutation was specifically granted for *both* sentences or for the second sentence independently. *   The petition was disposed of with this clarification."

        "arguments": "*   **Appellants' Counsel:** Argued the High Court acted on prejudice and suspicion, with no concrete material to prove conspiracy or connect them to the murder.

This significantly weakened the prosecution's case for direct involvement. *   **Conspiracy and Murder:** The Court found the High Court's conclusion of conspiracy and murder to be based on \"suspicions and surmises\" rather than concrete evidence, particularly regarding the timing of the murder (alleged to be March 11th by the High Court). The letter (Exhibit P15) was found by the Supreme Court to be misinterpreted by the High Court. *   **Section 202 IPC (A1):** The Court found that A1, upon returning to the house and discovering the decomposed body, had knowledge or reason to believe an unnatural death had occurred. His actions of suggesting cremation without informing authorities and his misleading statements to others indicated an intentional omission to provide information, fulfilling the ingredients of Section 202 IPC.",
        "decision": "*   **Background:** The deceased and A2 had a troubled marriage. The deceased was reportedly unhealthy and mentally unstable. *   **Discovery of Body:** On March 18, 1982, the deceased's decomposed body was found in her room. A2 was away on official duty, and A1 was in Jodhpur, returning to Jaipur on March 18th. *   **Initial Actions:** A1 called a doctor, informed the deceased's father, and suggested immediate cremation. The deceased's brother raised suspicions about the body's condition. *   **Medical Evidence:** The post-mortem report indicated death due to head injury and pressure on the neck, but noted the body's advanced decomposition. There were some ambiguities in the doctor's opinion regarding the exact cause and timing of death. *   **Trial Court Finding:** The trial court found insufficient evidence for conspiracy or murder and acquitted the accused, though it criticized their treatment of the deceased. *   **High Court Finding:** The High Court relied on evidence of ill-treatment, a perceived strong motive, and its interpretation of the medical evidence and the conduct of the accused after the death to convict them of conspiracy and murder. *   The Supreme Court **allowed** the appeal, **setting aside** the convictions and sentences awarded against both A1 and A2 for offenses under Sections 302, 34, and 120B IPC. *   The Supreme Court **convicted A1** under **Section 202 IPC** (Intentional omission to give information of offence by person bound to inform). *   A1 was **sentenced to six months' rigorous imprisonment** under Section 202 IPC. *   A2 was acquitted of all charges."

Mizaji was sentenced to death, and the others to life imprisonment for murder, with additional sentences for rioting. *   **Background:** The dispute concerned a piece of land (Sukhna field) where the deceased, Rameshwar, and others were in cultivating possession. Tej Singh had purchased the land from a previous owner, Banwari, but this sale was opposed by Rameshwar's party. *   **The Incident:** On July 27, 1957, the five appellants, armed with a spear (Tej Singh), a pistol (Mizaji), and lathis, went to the disputed field. Maiku began ploughing the field and destroying the Jowar crop. When Rameshwar and others arrived to protest, an altercation ensued. Tej Singh claimed he had bought the land and would do as he pleased.

        "issues": "*   The nature of the offense committed by the four appellants. *   The appropriateness of the sentence awarded to them. *   Specifically, the Court had to determine if the conviction of the first appellant for murder (Section 302 IPC) was justified and if convictions under Section 149 IPC were sustainable after the acquittal of two accused.",
        "arguments": "*   **Unlawful Assembly and Section 149 IPC:** The Court reasoned that Section 149 IPC, which holds members of an unlawful assembly liable for offenses committed in prosecution of their common object, requires an assembly of at least five members. Since the High Court acquitted two accused, leaving only four appellants, the assembly could no longer be considered unlawful under Section 141 IPC. Therefore, convictions based on Section 149 IPC were unsustainable for all appellants. *   **Conviction for Murder (Section 302 IPC):** The Court found that the first appellant, Subran, was not specifically charged with the substantive offense of murder under Section 302 IPC, but rather under Section 302 read with Section 149 IPC. Convicting him for the substantive offense of murder without a specific charge was impermissible and could have prejudiced his defense. *   **Medical Evidence:** The medical evidence indicated that while the deceased suffered numerous injuries, none of them individually were sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature.

No vital parts were directly targeted. *   **Individual Liability:** Given the failure of the Section 149 IPC charges, the Court determined that each appellant would be liable for their individual acts. *   **First Appellant's Liability:** While not guilty of murder due to lack of intent to kill or injuries sufficient to cause death, the first appellant, due to the weapon used (chopper) and the nature of injuries, could be attributed with the knowledge that death was likely. This brought his actions under Section 299 IPC, punishable under Section 304 Part I IPC (culpable homicide not amounting to murder). *   **Other Appellants' Liability:** The injuries caused by the second and third appellants (Rajan and Preman) with blunt weapons were considered grievous but not on vital parts, leading to a conviction under Section 325 IPC (grievous hurt).

Sovereign immunity is not a defense in such public law proceedings for the enforcement of fundamental rights. Compensation is a recognized remedy under Article 32, distinct from private law tort claims.",

        "arguments": "*   \"Ice stick\" is not \"ice candy\", so the prescribed standards don't apply. *   Conviction under Section 16(1A)(i) is incorrect because the Central Food Laboratory did not find dulcin, the substance declared injurious to health. *   Cannot be convicted under Section 16(1)(a)(i) as they were charged under Section 16(1A)(i). *   Delay in proceedings should lead to acquittal. *   The definition of \"ice candy\" in the Act includes \"ice Lollies or Edible Ice\" sold \"by whatever name it is sold.\" The \"ice stick\" clearly falls under this broad definition. *   The Central Food Laboratory report did not find dulcin, and saccharin alone, while prohibited, was not explicitly stated as \"injurious to health\" in the same way. Therefore, Section 16(1A)(i) was not applicable as the adulterant was not proven to be injurious to health under that specific clause. *   However, the presence of saccharin meant the \"ice stick\" did not conform to the prescribed standards for \"ice candy\". This constitutes adulteration under Section 2(ia)(m) of the Act (quality or purity falls below prescribed standard). *   Conviction is possible under Section 16(1)(a)(i) for adulteration under Section 2(ia)(m), as it is a less severe offence than Section 16(1A)(i).

The alleged conspiracy involved creating fake businesses and using them to obtain credit facilities through fabricated foreign letters of credit and forged shipping documents. The PNB was allegedly cheated of a significant amount. The Chief Judicial Magistrate discharged all accused, stating that the conspiracy and acts occurred outside India, thus requiring sanction under Section 188 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.), which was not obtained.

Any act done in furtherance of the conspiracy constitutes part of the offense. *   **Jurisdiction:** The Court examined Section 188 Cr.P.C., which requires Central Government sanction for offenses committed outside India. However, it emphasized that this sanction is only mandatory if the offense was *committed* outside India. *   **Location of Conspiracy:** The Court found that the conspiracy was hatched at Chandigarh. Even if the appellant was in Dubai, and subsequent acts occurred there, the agreement (the core of conspiracy) had a nexus with India. *   **Overt Acts and Consequences:** The Court held that if acts are committed in furtherance of a conspiracy, even if some occur abroad, and the consequences of the conspiracy and associated offenses ensue in India (like cheating PNB at Chandigarh), then the trial can proceed in India without prior sanction. The phrase \"offence committed outside India\" in Section 188 Cr.P.C. refers to the entire commission of the offense, not merely a part of it. *   **Exceptions to Section 188:** The Court reiterated that Section 188 applies to offenses committed outside India. However, if the conspiracy was hatched in India, or if overt acts and their consequences occurred in India, the sanction requirement is obviated.

        "case_facts": "*   **Background:** The case involves accusations of cheating and abetting cheating against Satwant Singh and Major Henderson, respectively, stemming from fraudulent claims submitted to the Government of Burma for work done during the Japanese invasion of Burma in 1942. *   **Claims and Payment:** Satwant Singh submitted large claims for work done, which were certified by Henderson. Based on these certifications, Satwant Singh was paid over Rs. 7 lakhs. *   **Discovery of Fraud:** The Government of Burma later discovered that many claims, including some of Satwant Singh's, were false. *   **Prosecution and Trial:** Satwant Singh was arrested and confessed. Both he and Henderson were prosecuted under the Indian Penal Code for cheating and abetment. Their case was heard by a Special Tribunal due to the nature of the offenses (corruption and cheating). *   **Procedural History:** The trial was affected by the partition of India. Henderson absconded and was later extradited. Henderson's request for witness examination abroad led to separate trials for Satwant Singh initially, but they were later jointly tried again.",
        "issues": "*   **Jurisdiction and Trial Validity:** Whether the trial of Satwant Singh was valid, particularly concerning: *   Compliance with Section 188 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) regarding offenses committed outside British India. *   The legality of a joint trial of Satwant Singh and Henderson. *   Whether sanction was required under Section 197 of the CrPC for the prosecution of Henderson. *   **Constitutionality of Fines:** Whether the \"compulsory\" fines imposed by the Special Tribunal, and subsequently upheld by the State's appeal, violated Article 20 of the Constitution (prohibition against ex post facto laws).",
        "arguments": "*   **Jurisdiction (Section 188 CrPC):** *   The defense argued that the offense was committed in Kolhapur (outside British India), requiring a Political Agent's certificate or Provincial Government sanction. *   The court found that the misrepresentation was in Simla and Jhansi (British India), and the payment was made in Lahore (British India) at Satwant Singh's request. *   The posting of cheques in Kolhapur did not constitute delivery or payment at Kolhapur in the legal sense for criminal proceedings. *   Therefore, no part of the cheating offense occurred outside British India, and Section 188 did not apply. *   **Joint Trial (Sections 179, 180, 233-239 CrPC):** *   The defense argued that Sections 179 and 180 did not permit a joint trial at Simla, and Sections 233-239, particularly Section 239(b), did not allow a joint trial for multiple offenses of cheating and abetment. *   The court found that Sections 179 and 180 were broad enough to allow trial where the act or consequence occurred. *   The court also noted that misjoinder of charges does not vitiate a trial unless it occasions a failure of justice, and there was no evidence of prejudice. *   **Sanction for Prosecution (Section 197 CrPC):** *   The defense argued that Henderson, as a public servant, required sanction under Section 197 CrPC for his prosecution, which was lacking or improperly granted. *   The court held that the offense of abetment of cheating, by its nature, cannot be considered an act done \"while acting or purporting to act in the discharge of official duty.\" The official status merely provided an occasion or opportunity. *   Therefore, Section 197 was inapplicable, regardless of whether Henderson was a public servant removable by the Governor-General in Council or Provincial Government. *   **\"Compulsory\" Fines and Article 20:**",
        "decision": "*   The court clarified that Section 10 of the Ordinance mandated a minimum fine not less than the procured amount, irrespective of imprisonment. *   Under Section 420 of the IPC, the fine was unlimited. *   **Satwant Singh's Appeals (Criminal Appeals Nos. 100-105 of 1954):** Dismissed. The conviction and sentence of imprisonment, as reduced by the High Court, were upheld. The sentence of \"ordinary\" fines was also maintained. The prayer for further reduction of sentence was rejected. *   **State of Punjab's Appeals (Criminal Appeals Nos. 124-129 of 1954):** Allowed. The High Court's order setting aside the \"compulsory\" fines was reversed, and the Special Tribunal's order imposing these fines was restored. The prayer for enhancement of \"ordinary\" fines was implicitly rejected by not being granted. *   **Petition No. 31 of 1952:** Dismissed, as the conviction of the petitioner (Satwant Singh) was upheld."

The thirteenth accused was tried separately as a juvenile. *   The motive for the attack was alleged to be dissatisfaction over the acquittal of two brothers in a previous murder case. *   The prosecution case was that the appellants and others attacked and killed Kurji, Harji, and Mitha. *   The defense claimed false implication due to enmity.",
        "issues": "*   Whether the conviction of the appellants for murder under IPC sections 149 and 34 is valid, especially after the acquittal of several co-accused, reducing the number of convicted persons below the minimum required for an unlawful assembly (five) or conspiracy (two). *   Whether the appellants can be held constructively liable for the fatal blows, given the absence of a specific finding as to who delivered them, and the acquittal of others who might have delivered them. *   Whether the sentences imposed are appropriate given the circumstances, including the prior murder of a family member and the father's lesser sentence.",
        "arguments": "*   **On Section 149:** The High Court's finding was that the unlawful assembly consisted of the four convicted persons and other *unidentified* persons, totaling 10-13. This is legally permissible. The court cited previous cases (Kapildeo Singh, Dalip Singh, Nar Singh) establishing that it's not necessary for all members of the unlawful assembly to be identified or convicted, as long as it's proven that at least five persons formed the assembly with a common object. The mere fact that fewer than five individuals were convicted does not invalidate section 149 if the existence of a larger unlawful assembly is established. *   **On Section 34:** This section is intended for situations where individual acts are difficult to distinguish or prove. Once a criminal act is found to be done in furtherance of a common intention by multiple individuals, each is liable as if they acted alone. The court distinguished previous cases (Prabhu Babaji Navle) where the number of convicted individuals fell to one or where common intention with unknown persons couldn't be proven. In this case, four individuals were convicted, and there was a finding that they shared common intention with others whose identity was not established. *   **On Sentence:** The court found no reason to interfere with the death sentence, citing the appellants' leading role in the \"enormity of the crime\" and the premeditated murders.",
        "decision": "The appeal was **dismissed**. The Court held that: *   The conviction of the appellants under IPC section 302 read with section 149 is valid, as the High Court established the existence of an unlawful assembly of more than five persons (including identified convicted individuals and unidentified others) with a common object, even though not all members were convicted or identified. *   The conviction of the appellants under IPC section 302 read with section 34 is also valid. The common intention was established, and the criminal act (murder) was done in furtherance of that intention by the convicted individuals (four of them acting together with others). It is not necessary to prove who delivered the fatal blows in such cases. *   The death sentence imposed on the appellants was upheld."

There, with additional individuals, they dismembered the bodies and threw them into a stream. *   **Reporting:** The father of the deceased, Bela Singh, reported the incident the following morning. *   **Investigation:** A police investigation led to charges against seven people, including the appellants.",
        "issues": "*   Whether the conviction of the appellants for murder was justified based on the evidence presented. *   The admissibility and weight of evidence, particularly the direct oral testimony of eyewitnesses and the circumstantial evidence. *   The interpretation and application of Section 27 of the Indian Evidence Act regarding evidence discovered based on information from accused individuals, especially when multiple accused provide similar information.",

        "issues": "*   Many workers did not comply, and a sit-down strike ensued, followed by another strike a week later. *   The Company filed a complaint under Section 27 of the Act, leading to the appellants' conviction. *   The convictions were upheld by the Additional Sessions Judge and the Calcutta High Court. *   Were the strikes instigated by the appellants illegal under the Act? *   Specifically, were the strikes illegal because they were in contravention of Section 22 of the Act? *   Alternatively, could the strikes be considered legal if they were in consequence of an illegal lock-out by the Company, as per Section 24(3) of the Act? *   Did the Company's notices constitute an illegal \"lock-out\" as defined by the Act? *   Does the definition of \"lock-out\" in Section 2(1) of the Act include the discharge of employees? *   Was the sanction granted by the government to file the complaint valid?",
        "arguments": "*   **Illegality of Strikes:** The respondent (State) argued the strikes were illegal under Section 24(1) for contravening Section 22. The appellants argued they were legal consequences of an illegal lock-out by the Company. *   **Definition of Lock-out:** The appellants contended the Company's notices, using phrases like \"considered to be no longer employed,\" matched the definition of a lock-out (\"refusal by an employer to continue to employ\"). *   **Lock-out vs. Discharge:** The Court examined whether a \"discharge\" of employees falls within the definition of \"lock-out.\" *   The Court found the language in the notices (\"considered to be no longer employed\") and the statutory definition of lock-out (\"refusal by an employer to continue to employ\") were not identical in meaning when considered in context. *   The Court held that the Company's notices effectively constituted a discharge of employees, not a lock-out. The notices indicated a termination of employment, not a refusal to allow work without termination. *   The Court reasoned that interpreting \"lock-out\" to include \"discharge\" would lead to conflicts with other sections of the Act (e.g., Section 33 regarding discharge during conciliation proceedings) and would disrupt the industrial relations framework, where strikes and lock-outs are counterparts and do not typically involve severance of employment. *   The Court also noted that subsequent amendments to the Act, introducing definitions for \"retrenchment,\" further supported the view that \"lock-out\" did not encompass \"discharge.\" *   **Sanction for Complaint:** The appellants challenged the government's sanction to file the complaint, citing a precedent. The Court found ample evidence that the sanctioning authority had been presented with all necessary facts, rendering the sanction valid, even if not explicitly stated on the sanction document itself.",
        "decision": "*   The Court ruled that the Company's notices constituted a **discharge** of employees, not an illegal **lock-out** as defined by the Act. Therefore, the strikes were not legal consequences of an illegal lock-out. *   The Court found the strikes to be in contravention of Section 22 and thus illegal under Section 24(1) of the Act. *   The Court found the sanction for filing the complaint to be valid. *   However, considering the long passage of time, the Court **modified the sentence** for each appellant to a fine of Rs. 100, with simple imprisonment for fifteen days in default of payment, in addition to the period already served."

Section 339 deals with forfeiture of pardon, not its initial valid tender. The cited cases concerned the application of Section 339 and were distinguishable. *   The fact that the pardon order mentioned Section 5 of the Official Secrets Act alongside other offences did not make the pardon valid for those offences if the law (Section 337(1)) did not permit it.",

The appellants argued the current Act attempts to achieve the same unconstitutional result. *   The impugned provisions create discriminatory treatment, violating Article 14.

This is not discriminatory as it's discretionary and often the proof of such offenses is tied to the main scheduled offense, similar to normal procedure. *   **Distinction from Previous Cases:** The Court distinguished the present Act from the invalidated Section 5(1) of the earlier West Bengal Special Courts Act, 1950, noting that the current Act has a clear preamble outlining its object and the classification is based on rational differentia. *   **Article 14 Violation:** The dissenting judge found Section 2(b) to be void. *   **Discriminatory Procedure:** The Act prescribes a procedure less beneficial to the accused (e.g., no jury trial, no commitment proceedings).",

Tiwari. Kashmira Singh had allegedly expressed a desire for revenge. *   **Prosecution Case:** Kashmira Singh, driven by revenge, enlisted Gurubachan Singh to help murder Ramesh. The murder was committed in a revolting manner in Gurudayal Singh's house. The body was then concealed in a gunny bag and bedding roll, moved to a chowkidar's hut, and later transported by rickshaw to a well and thrown in. *   **Key Evidence:** Gurubachan Singh's confession was crucial in implicating Kashmira Singh. Other evidence included previous association, appellant's absence from a Gurudwara around the time of the murder, disposal of the body (rickshaw ride, sari borders used to tie the bag), and the discovery of a coat and safa with bloodstains.",

His testimony alone, without corroboration, was not sufficient. However, the discovery of sari borders (matching one found in appellant's house) provided corroboration for the act of tying the gunny bag and his presence in the rickshaw with the body. *   **Coat and Safa:** The evidence linking the coat and safa to Kashmira Singh was found insufficient due to discrepancies in the description of the coat and the fact it was not worn at a relevant time. *   **Motive:** The motive for revenge was accepted, but the Court noted other dismissed individuals also had similar motives. *   **Focus on Independent Evidence:** The Court meticulously examined each piece of evidence, attempting to separate the impact of Gurubachan's confession.

Das, J.):** *   **Medical Evidence:** The medical evidence, particularly the testimony of Dr. Mehta, strongly indicated that Laxmibai's death was *not* due to diabetic coma, despite initial hospital diagnoses. Dr. Mehta concluded it was likely due to an undetectable poison. The autopsy and chemical analysis failed to detect any poison, but the court acknowledged that many poisons leave no trace. *   **Appellant's Conduct:** The appellant's actions were highly suspicious and pointed to a premeditated plan. This included: *   Traveling with Laxmibai in the same compartment and being present at her death. *   Providing a false name and history to hospital staff. *   Concealing Laxmibai's death from her relatives and friends. *   Misappropriating her property through forgeries and manipulation *before* and *after* her death. *   Arranging for the cancellation of the postmortem examination, which was viewed as an attempt to cover up the crime. *   Taking Laxmibai to a more distant hospital, possibly due to a prior acquaintance with the Resident Medical Officer, Dr. Mouskar. *   The disappearance of Laxmibai's belongings, including ornaments. *   **Circumstantial Evidence:** The cumulative effect of the appellant's conduct and the medical uncertainty created a strong inference of guilt. The court emphasized that murder by poisoning is often secret and relies on circumstantial evidence, drawing parallels to other case law where conviction occurred without direct proof of poison or even a body. *   **Motive:** The appellant's extensive misappropriation of Laxmibai's property provided a clear motive for murder. *   **Dissenting Opinion (Sarkar, J.):** *   **Medical Evidence:** Dr. Mehta's opinion that death was *probably* due to poison was not conclusive. The postmortem and chemical analysis found no poison. The medical experts could not definitively determine the cause of death, and the possibility of natural causes could not be entirely ruled out. *   **Circumstantial Evidence:** While acknowledging the appellant's motive to misappropriate property and his dishonesty after Laxmibai's death, Justice Sarkar found these circumstances insufficient to prove unnatural death or murder. *   **Cancellation of Postmortem:** Justice Sarkar argued that the evidence did not conclusively prove the appellant influenced the cancellation of the postmortem. He suggested Dr. Anija might have had her own reasons to alter the records to cover up a mistake in treatment, and Dr. Mouskar's actions were either innocent or not definitively linked to the appellant's influence. *   **Other Circumstances:** He found other circumstances (like giving a false name, traveling in the same compartment, taking the patient to G.T. Hospital, disappearance of belongings) to be inconclusive or explainable by natural reasons, or not definitively linked to the appellant's guilt. He also doubted if the appellant had administered poison on the train given the public setting.",

        "arguments": "*   **Jaswant Singh's Testimony:** The court held that Section 540 of the Criminal Procedure Code allows for the examination of additional witnesses at any stage if necessary.

Any irregularity in this procedure was curable under Section 537 of the Criminal Procedure Code, especially since the defense was aware of the witness and raised no objection at the trial. The court found no prejudice to the appellant. *   **Use of Hostile Witness Statements:** The court clarified that previous statements of hostile witnesses could be used for corroboration (under Section 157 of the Evidence Act) or to shake credibility (under Section 146). If the witness admits to having made the previous statement, it can be used to support the evidence-in-chief, even if not strictly substantive evidence, as it reinforces the believable testimony.

The certificate of the Committing Magistrate (under Section 80 of the Evidence Act) creating a presumption of correctness was binding unless proven otherwise. The court dismissed the suggestion that the Committing Magistrate should be examined.

Also argued that physical presence at the time of misappropriation is necessary for Section 34 IPC. Contended the sentence was severe and discriminatory compared to the second appellant. *   Direct evidence of misappropriation is not always required; failure to account and a false explanation can lead to conviction. *   The first appellant's claim of being unaware or unable to oversee operations was contradicted by his own statements about frequent visits to the mill and being informed about the diminishing cloth. *   Section 34 IPC requires common intention and participation, but physical presence is not always necessary, especially in offenses involving multiple acts at different times and places.

His body was placed in a trunk, moved, and eventually thrown into a well. *   **Discovery:** The trunk was recovered from a well after about a month and ten days, following reports of a foul smell. *   **Investigation & Trial:** The investigation was significantly delayed. Mohinderpal Singh was a fugitive. Palvinder Kaur was tried alone. *   Whether the circumstantial evidence was sufficient to prove that Palvinder Kaur committed the murder of her husband under Section 302 IPC. *   Whether the High Court erred in convicting Palvinder Kaur under Section 201 IPC, particularly concerning the admissibility and weight of her alleged confession and the proof of an underlying offence. *   Whether Palvinder Kaur's statement to the magistrate, which was partly exculpatory and partly inculpatory, could be used as evidence against her, and if so, how. *   Whether the prosecution had affirmatively established that Jaspal Singh died as a result of an offence (specifically poisoning) before convicting Palvinder Kaur under Section 201 IPC.",
        "arguments": "*   **Murder Charge (Section 302):** The Court agreed with the High Court that the evidence was insufficient to convict for murder. There was no direct evidence, and circumstantial evidence was not strong enough to exclude innocent explanations or prove Palvinder Kaur's involvement. *   **Evidence of Death:** Crucially, the Supreme Court found **no evidence to affirmatively establish that Jaspal Singh died due to potassium cyanide poisoning**. The post-mortem doctor's evidence indicated a lack of characteristic signs of corrosive poisoning. *   **Confession (Section 201 Charge):** The Court found Palvinder Kaur's statement to the magistrate to be **exculpatory**, not a confession, as it denied guilt and suggested accidental death. It could not be used as evidence to prove guilt. The High Court erred by treating it as evidence and by accepting only the inculpatory part (disposal of the body) while rejecting the exculpatory part (accidental death), which is contrary to the rule that confessions must be accepted or rejected whole. *   **Section 201 IPC:** To convict under Section 201, it is essential to first prove that an offence was committed. Since the cause of Jaspal Singh's death (poisoning) could not be proven, the charge under Section 201 IPC must also fail. *   **Suspicion vs. Proof:** The Court emphasized that suspicions, however strong, are insufficient for conviction, especially when the investigation involved false witnesses and significant delays.",
        "decision": "The Supreme Court **allowed the appeal**. *   The conviction of Palvinder Kaur under Section 201 of the Indian Penal Code was **set aside**. *   Palvinder Kaur was **acquitted** of the charge under Section 201 IPC. *   The Court held that there was no sufficient evidence to prove the cause of Jaspal Singh's death, and therefore, the charge of concealing evidence of an offence could not stand. The alleged confession was inadmissible as evidence, and the circumstantial evidence was insufficient to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt."

        "arguments": "*   English case law (Gibson vs Barton, Edmonds vs Foster, Park vs Lawton) established that a person responsible for not calling a meeting cannot use their own default as a defense to avoid prosecution for failing to file documents related to that meeting. *   The same principle applied to Section 32 also applies to Section 131. The failure to call the general meeting, if willful, cannot be a defense for not laying the accounts before it. *   The precedent case (Imperator vs Pioneer Clay and Industrial Works Ltd.) was distinguished due to differences in the language of the specific sections involved and the court's agreement with the English precedent that a willful default prevents reliance on the absence of a meeting.",
        "decision": "*   The failure to hold the meeting, if willful, constitutes a default that allows prosecution under Section 32. *   The daily fine provision in Section 32(5) suggests that a default can continue, implying it can occur even if the meeting hasn't been held. The default occurs after the due date for filing has passed, which is linked to when the meeting *should* have been held. *   Cases cited by the respondents (Queen vs Newton, Dorte vs South African Super Aeration Ltd.) were distinguished or found not to conflict with the established principle. *   The Supreme Court **allowed** the appeals. *   The case was **remanded** back to the Chief Presidency Magistrate to be tried on its merits."

        "arguments": "*   The Additional Munsif's order to seize account books was not a procedural matter but an invasion of private rights. Courts have no inherent power to forcibly seize property. *   Specific procedures for obtaining evidence exist in the CPC, and a court cannot collect evidence for a party or prevent potential forgery by seizing books. *   The appointment was therefore without jurisdiction and null and void. *   The State's reliance on other CPC provisions was rejected as inapplicable. *   Explanation 2 to Section 21 of the IPC applies only when there is a pre-existing post or office of a public servant. It does not apply when the appointing authority lacks the power to appoint or when no such office exists. *   In this case, there was no existing \"office of Commissioner,\" and the Munsif had no authority to create one for the purpose of seizing account books. Therefore, Sri Raghubir Pershad was not a public servant under the IPC.",
        "decision": "*   The Supreme Court held that Sri Raghubir Pershad was **not a public servant** as his appointment as Commissioner was illegal and void. *   Consequently, the appellants did **not commit an offence** under Section 165A of the IPC by offering him a bribe. *   The appeal was **allowed**, the convictions were set aside, and the appellants were acquitted.

A delay in submitting the report under Section 12(6) doesn't affect the settlement's legality. * **For the Respondent (Management):** The High Court argued that the settlement was invalid because the union was not recognized, the conciliation officer gave insufficient notice, and the settlement did not bind all laborers. * A dispute can be an industrial dispute even if sponsored by an unregistered union or by a section of workmen, falling under Section 18(3) of the Act. * The settlement, signed by the union's General Secretary and executive committee members, was binding. * The notice requirement under Section 11(2) is for entering premises and does not affect the conciliation officer's jurisdiction. * Failure to submit the report within the stipulated time under Section 12(6) does not invalidate the settlement. * A subsequent settlement on October 6, 1956, resolved all outstanding disputes, with many discharged workmen reinstated.",

This procedure involves a complaint by the Public Prosecutor with prior government sanction and is heard by the Court of Session. *   The Court reasoned that Section 198B was intended as an *additional* remedy (as indicated by the phrase \"in addition to, and not in derogation of\") and not one that superseded or supplemented Section 198 (which requires a complaint by the aggrieved person before a Magistrate). *   The Court held that the \"notwithstanding anything contained in this Code\" clause in Section 198B(1) meant that the usual procedure under Section 198 was excluded for cases falling under Section 198B. *   Interpreting Section 198B(13) as requiring both a Public Prosecutor's complaint and the aggrieved person's complaint would lead to confusion, with two simultaneous proceedings in different courts. *   The Court found that Section 198B was designed in the public interest to protect Ministers and public servants from expensive and prolonged defamation proceedings, allowing the State to bear the cost and control the proceedings. The aggrieved person still had to support the complaint with evidence, making them involved. *   The Court disagreed with interpretations that suggested Section 198B(13) necessitated the aggrieved person signing the complaint.",

        "issues": "*   Whether the Bombay Security Measures Act, 1947, specifically Section 12 which allows the State Government to direct specific cases to be tried by a Special Judge, is unconstitutional and void under Article 14 (Right to Equality) of the Constitution. *   If the Act or Section 12 is found void, does this invalidate the trial and convictions of the appellants, even though the trial commenced before the Constitution came into force? *   Can the principles established in prior Supreme Court cases like *Keshavan Madhava Menon* and *State of West Bengal v. Anwar Ali Sarkar* be applied to this case? *   Article 14's equal protection clause applies to the entire period of the trial. If the procedure becomes discriminatory after January 26, 1950, the accused are entitled to the equal protection of the laws from that date onwards. *   The fact that a case was referred before the Constitution does not create a vested right in a discriminatory procedure. *   The classification (based on whether a case was referred before the Constitution) is not rational and has no nexus to the Act's objects. It's a \"fanciful classification.\" *   The discrimination continued after the Constitution, violating the appellants' fundamental rights. Therefore, the conviction and sentence based on this continued discriminatory procedure should be set aside.",
        "arguments": "*   While Section 12 of the Act might be discriminatory in principle (as per *Anwar Ali Sarkar*), it does not automatically invalidate trials that had already validly commenced before the Constitution. *   The principle from *Keshavan Madhava Menon* holds that the Constitution's fundamental rights provisions are not retrospective. Existing laws remain valid for past transactions and accrued rights/liabilities. *   The appellants' trial was lawfully commenced under a valid Act. The continuation of the trial was merely \"working out the application\" of that Act. *   The situation of a pending trial commenced before the Constitution is distinct from that of a new case initiated after the Constitution.

Some procedural variations (like memorandum of evidence, discretion in summoning witnesses) were minor and potentially curable or did not fundamentally undermine the trial. *   The application of the Criminal Procedure Code's Section 1(2) also prevents the ordinary procedure from overriding the special procedure prescribed by a valid law.",
