Case: Criminal Appeal No. 15 of 1950
Court: Supreme Court of India
Judge: Fazl Ali J.
Date: March 19, 1950

Case Facts:
- Appellant: Licensee of two petrol stations in Guntur, resident of Chirala.
- Employees managed the petrol stations on his behalf.
- Charges: Supplying petrol without coupons (clause 22 + clause 5), accepting coupons in advance without supply (clause 27), supplying petrol without endorsing coupons (clause 27A) under Motor Spirit Rationing Order, 1941 (Rule 81 of Defence of India Rules).
- Appellant argued he was not present, issued instructions to employees, and had no knowledge of breaches.

Issues:

Arguments/Reasoning:

- Court held: Clauses 22 and 27 require mens rea; conviction quashed. Clause 27A imposes absolute duty on supplier; conviction upheld.
