Case facts: 
Appellant: Mohinder Singh.
Incident occurred on 28th February 1949 near a Gurdwara in village Augar, Punjab.
Victims: Dalip Singh (killed) and Jita Singh (injured), brothers of Bachittar Singh.
Background: Dispute over a tree cut by 7 persons including Mohinder Singh.
Events: Mohinder Singh and Gurnam Singh attacked the brothers; Dalip Singh was shot and died on the spot. Jita Singh was injured. Police investigation followed, leading to charges under IPC sections 302 and 307 read with section 34.

Issues: 
Was Mohinder Singh guilty of the murder of Dalip Singh and attempted murder of Jita Singh?
Could the alleged injuries have been caused by Mohinder Singh’s gun (exhibit P16)?
Was the prosecution evidence sufficient and reliable to convict the appellant?
Was the plea of alibi credible and properly evaluated?

Arguments/Reasoning: 
Prosecution relied on oral testimony of 3 witnesses; medical evidence and ballistic expert’s evidence were considered unsatisfactory or inconclusive.
Doubts existed regarding the weapon used, nature of injuries, and eyewitness reliability.
Alibi evidence (appearance before Naib Tehsildar on 28th Feb) suggested Mohinder Singh may not have been present at the crime scene.
Courts below failed to adequately address material gaps in prosecution case, ignored expert evidence, and relied solely on oral testimonies that were not fully independent or credible.
Supreme Court emphasized the principle: prosecution must prove all essential elements of the case beyond reasonable doubt, particularly in capital punishment matters.

Decision/Holding: 
Appeal allowed.
Conviction under IPC sections 302 and 307 read with section 34 set aside.
Mohinder Singh released immediately.
Supreme Court noted the trial and High Court proceedings did not constitute a fair and proper trial.
