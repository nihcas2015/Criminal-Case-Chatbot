Case facts: 
Appellant: General Manager of Jagdishpur Zamindary Company.
Incident occurred on 6th December, 1947 at Bhita Sugar Factory, Patna.
Background: The company had failed to comply with orders for supply of sugar under the Sugar and Sugar Products Control Order, 1947.
Government order dated 5th December, 1947 authorized District Magistrate and Special Officer to seize 5,000 maunds of sugar from the company.
On 6th December, 1947, appellant obstructed officers by locking godowns, blocking roads with coal, firewood, and tins, and making a railway siding unserviceable.
Officers required armed police to remove sugar.

Issues: 
Whether the appellant’s obstruction constituted an offence under section 186 of the Indian Penal Code.
Whether the government order of 5th December, 1947 was legal and valid.
Whether obstruction of an act done in good faith by public officers constitutes an offence.

Arguments/Reasoning: 
Appellant argued the government order was illegal under the Essential Supplies (Temporary Powers) Act, 1946 and obstruction to an illegal order could not be an offence.
Respondent argued that an act done honestly and in good faith by a public servant in discharge of public duties suffices for offence under section 186.
Court considered scope of section 3 of the Act: subsection (1) confers power to regulate or prohibit production, supply, and distribution of essential commodities, and covers both general and special orders.
Subsection (2) is illustrative; seizure of articles falls within powers under subsection (1).
Reference to the prior incomplete order (27th September, 1947) was immaterial; 5th December order valid.
Precedents (Calcutta High Court and Privy Council) supported wide interpretation of powers and illustrative nature of subsection (2).

Decision/Holding: 
Appeal dismissed.
Order of 5th December, 1947 held valid.
Appellant’s obstruction constituted an offence under section 186 IPC.
Appellant’s bail bond cancelled; ordered to surrender.
