Here's a summary of the judgment in clear sections:

## Summary of Judgment

### 1. Case Facts

*   The appellant, General Manager of Jagdishpur Zamindary Company, was convicted under Section 186 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) for obstructing public servants.
*   The obstruction occurred when government officials attempted to seize 5,000 maunds of sugar from the company's factory on December 6, 1947.
*   This seizure was based on a Government of Bihar order dated December 5, 1947, which followed the company's alleged failure to comply with previous sugar supply orders.
*   The appellant's defense was that the seizure order was illegal because it was passed under an invalid interpretation of Section 3 of the Essential Supplies (Temporary Powers) Act, 1946.

### 2. Issues

*   **Primary Issue:** Whether the Government order authorizing the seizure of sugar was legally valid and within the powers granted by Section 3 of the Essential Supplies (Temporary Powers) Act, 1946.
*   **Secondary Issue (Implicit):** Whether obstruction of a public servant acting under an allegedly invalid order constitutes an offense under Section 186 of the IPC.

### 3. Arguments/Reasoning

*   **Appellant's Argument:**
    *   Section 3(1) of the Act only permits general regulations, not specific ad hoc orders against particular individuals or entities.
    *   Therefore, the order of December 5, 1947, was illegal and void.
    *   The previous order of September 27, 1947, was inchoate and could not be contravened, making the seizure based on anticipated contravention unlawful.
    *   Obstruction of an unlawful act by a public servant is not an offense under Section 186 IPC.

*   **Respondent's Argument (Implied):**
    *   The Government had the authority to pass specific orders under Section 3 of the Act.
    *   Even if the order was later found to be irregular, obstruction of a public servant acting in good faith in their perceived duty constitutes an offense.

*   **Court's Reasoning:**
    *   **Interpretation of Section 3:** The Court rejected the narrow interpretation of Section 3(1). It held that "notified order" can encompass special orders, and the powers under Section 3(1) are broad enough to include issuing specific directions to particular individuals or entities. This view is supported by Section 4 (delegation powers) and Section 15 (contemplating orders against particular persons).
    *   **Validity of Seizure Order:** The Court found that the seizure of sugar was competent under Section 3(1) of the Act, irrespective of the anticipated contravention of the September 27, 1947, order. Even if the reference to the prior order was redundant or based on a flawed premise, the power to seize sugar was inherent in Section 3(1).
    *   **Supporting Precedent:** The Court relied on the Privy Council decision in *Sibnath Banerjee's case* to support the interpretation that sub-section (2) of Section 3 is illustrative and does not restrict the broader powers granted by sub-section (1).
    *   **Obstruction Offense:** By deeming the seizure order valid, the Court concluded that the appellant's obstruction constituted an offense under Section 186 IPC. The need to definitively rule on the scope of Section 186 was rendered unnecessary by the finding of a valid seizure order.

### 4. Decision/Holding

*   The appeal was dismissed.
*   The conviction of the appellant under Section 186 of the Indian Penal Code was upheld.
*   The Court found the order authorizing the seizure of sugar to be valid under Section 3 of the Essential Supplies (Temporary Powers) Act, 1946.
*   The appellant's obstruction of public servants in carrying out this valid order constituted an offense.
